I would like to replace my reliable Yamaha 9.9 HP 4-stroke outboard motor with an electric pod drive or electric outboard motor for my boat, for example the Elco EP-14 or the ePropulsion 6kW pod drive. My sailboat is a Dutch flat-bottomed boat from 1965 with a displacement of 3.2 tons, and I usually run the Yamaha at no more than 1/3 of its power—very rarely more. I’ve never used the motor for more than 4 hours at a time, since I can sail almost everywhere in my North Sea cruising area, and I only go out when sailing is possible.

1fh0qev,sailing,Selecting Electric Outboard for 26ft Monohull (Avator 7.5e?) ,"Selecting Electric Outboard for 26ft Monohull (Avator 7.5e?)  Okay, so I have a very unique question and I am going crazy trying to figure out what size motor to select for my sailboat. For reference, I have a 26ft MacGregor 26S monohull. Also, I am dead set on not running gas on my boat because of some lakes that I would like to take it to one day. I tried using a 30lb. trolling motor on the lake the other day into a headwind and we completely stalled (I do realize that this motor is 12V and 30A, so only 360 Watts and it has a much different prop). 

I bought this sailboat last year for what I feel was a very fair price for a mostly ready-to-sail boat ($4300) and trailer. The problem that I have had with this boat is the motor. The motor is a 4HP Coleman outboard from 2010. It is a 4-stroke. The first time I took it out on the water, it died within a few minutes. Turns out it had flooded. I took the carburetor off and took it apart to see what was going on (suspecting a stuck needle valve). Needle valve was perfectly fine, and the jets were completely clear. While putting it back together, I noticed that the float was full of gas and that was what was keeping the needle valve open. No problem. I replaced the carb, and fixed the one I already had so that I had a backup. I get the motor running like silk (for a cheap 4-stroke anyway). Take it out, and while running at low idle (the 4HP was capable of pushing my boat at about 5mph at lowest idle) it kept flooding EVEN STILL. So for now, I am done. 

  
When I bought the boat, I fully expected to replace the motor because I didn't find a Coleman outboard reliable. However, upon looking into it, I am really wanting to go with an electric outboard. The benefits far outweigh the cons for me (primarily, no gas, no noise, no vibration, and a high reliability). We live on the coast of North Carolina, and would therefore be sailing in local lakes AND coastal areas. I teach electrical engineering and am very familiar with electric motors and their reliability which fuels my desire to do this. Here is where I disconnect from knowing what to do: I am not sure what size electric outboard would be necessary for my sailboat. Currently, the 4HP I have pushes great (when it works). Here are some that I am looking at:

  
1. Mercury Avator 7.5e. This is a good bit of money, I get it. However, this is the one I would like to get if it'll be enough power for my boat. It is supposed to be a 3.5HP equivalent, which would put it right at the power that I currently have. 

  
2. ePropulsion Navy 3.0/6.0. This is the other option I am looking at if the Mercury Avator isn't enough power. I would like to avoid this for reasons that include the price AND the size of the battery that I would have to store in my boat. These motors are 6HP and 9.9HP equivalents respectively. 

  
Does anyone have any experience with this arena? If so, I would love some input and ideas! Thank you!",1726361993.0,7,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1fh0qev/selecting_electric_outboard_for_26ft_monohull/
1bly6z0,sailing,Dinghy Choices,"Dinghy Choices So I'm planning to get a new dinghy to replace my old West Marine RU250 dinghy/ePropulsion Spirit with a combo that planes and is light-weight enough to lift onto the foredeck (no davits). Looking at this dinghy setup for frequent week-long trips, mainly coastal.

I've been looking at specifically the Highfield RU200, Takacat 260LX, and Highfield UL220. The Takacat sounds practical with its catamaran and, most importantly for me, draining design, but it's a little big and bluntly a bit ugly in my opinion. The RU200 would be a great size to leave on the foredeck, and could have either an airfloor or aluminum floor, both of which seem to act as a double floor which is a likely unintentional benefit. I'm leaning towards the aluminum floor as I plan to leave the boat inflated on trips, and in the slip, deflate and bring home. The UL220 seems like it might get onto plane easier, and it is obviously a more solid boat.

Also looking at a Yamaha 6hp 4-stroke.

What do you think? Would the RU200 get on plane with that outboard? Is the ultralight worth the extra weight and lack of flexibility? Please let me know your thoughts--thanks.",1711216147.0,6,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1bly6z0/dinghy_choices/
12vtqqg,sailing,Dinghy on Foredeck of Small Sailboat,"Dinghy on Foredeck of Small Sailboat Hey,

I'm looking for the best dinghy to stow on the foredeck of my Flicka 20. My criteria are that it must fit 2 people (although mainly used with 1), ideally an inflatable floor for better maneuverability, and, most importantly, it must fit in the VERY limited foredeck area.

I'll be using it with an ePropulsion Spirit 1.0 outboard I have. I also currently have an 8'3"" RU-250 from West Marine which has worked fine, but I can't stand the turning ability with no keel (especially alone sitting on a tube) and it, as you can see, does not fit in the foredeck and very much hinders visibility and maneuverability to the bow.

It mostly works to very slowly get us out of the marina channel and back in again. I say mostly because the other day, with winds blowing into the channel at 9mph, I lost rudder control trying to motor out and almost got blown into the shallows, simply because the trolling motor was no match for wind pressure against the boat's hull. I was able to take advantage of the pirouette momentum and motor with the wind back into the marina, and I probably could've raised the mainsail and powered out of the situation as well. But the experience left me wanting more power. 

A sailboat of my size should have a 15HP outboard motor in its lazerette, by the conventional charts, but the previous owner got by with a 4HP motor which was much easier to pull out when not in use. That motor was 20-years old and done by the time I acquired the boat, so I replaced it with the itty bitty Newport trolling motor as an experiment. 

I don't want to go back to internal combustion for power. Torqeedo and Epropulsion make powerful trolling motors and charge thousands of dollars for them. Haswing just came out last year with a sub-$1,000 5HP model, but I can find no review information on it. (I just posted a related question to r/boating seeking input on the Haswing, figuring pontoon boaters etc are far more likely to have used one.)

TLDR: I'd like to know what experience other day sailors of medium size boats have with the more powerful electric trolling motors.

Okay, so I have a very unique question and I am going crazy trying to figure out what size motor to select for my sailboat. For reference, I have a 26ft MacGregor 26S monohull. Also, I am dead set on not running gas on my boat because of some lakes that I would like to take it to one day. I tried using a 30lb. trolling motor on the lake the other day into a headwind and we completely stalled (I do realize that this motor is 12V and 30A, so only 360 Watts and it has a much different prop). 

I bought this sailboat last year for what I feel was a very fair price for a mostly ready-to-sail boat ($4300) and trailer. The problem that I have had with this boat is the motor. The motor is a 4HP Coleman outboard from 2010. It is a 4-stroke. The first time I took it out on the water, it died within a few minutes. Turns out it had flooded. I took the carburetor off and took it apart to see what was going on (suspecting a stuck needle valve). Needle valve was perfectly fine, and the jets were completely clear. While putting it back together, I noticed that the float was full of gas and that was what was keeping the needle valve open. No problem. I replaced the carb, and fixed the one I already had so that I had a backup. I get the motor running like silk (for a cheap 4-stroke anyway). Take it out, and while running at low idle (the 4HP was capable of pushing my boat at about 5mph at lowest idle) it kept flooding EVEN STILL. So for now, I am done. 

  
When I bought the boat, I fully expected to replace the motor because I didn't find a Coleman outboard reliable. However, upon looking into it, I am really wanting to go with an electric outboard. The benefits far outweigh the cons for me (primarily, no gas, no noise, no vibration, and a high reliability). We live on the coast of North Carolina, and would therefore be sailing in local lakes AND coastal areas. I teach electrical engineering and am very familiar with electric motors and their reliability which fuels my desire to do this. Here is where I disconnect from knowing what to do: I am not sure what size electric outboard would be necessary for my sailboat. Currently, the 4HP I have pushes great (when it works). Here are some that I am looking at:

  
1. Mercury Avator 7.5e. This is a good bit of money, I get it. However, this is the one I would like to get if it'll be enough power for my boat. It is supposed to be a 3.5HP equivalent, which would put it right at the power that I currently have. 

  
2. ePropulsion Navy 3.0/6.0. This is the other option I am looking at if the Mercury Avator isn't enough power. I would like to avoid this for reasons that include the price AND the size of the battery that I would have to store in my boat. These motors are 6HP and 9.9HP equivalents respectively.

Should I connect it to my rotary switch, or direct wire to the battery with a fuse in line? 

How big of a fuse? What gauge wire?

We have enough saved to pay for 2 years of moorage, insurance, pay for the boat, in additional to a repair budget. Hubby can fix pretty much anything and we are aware of how hard boat ownership is.

I've an auxiliary/dinghy OB which is on an drop down transom mount.
Although this is a lightweight 2.5hp Yammy and has been fine for getting the boat back home slowly when the wind dies although this has only been on a lake so calm flat conditions with no tides or currents to deal with.

Hoping to do some coastal hops in the new year so I'm considering a new OB of 8 ~ 9 hp and wondering if anyone has any suggestions they might recommend?

I'm familiar with the Yamaha models available (8hp & 9.9hp) but have had no exposure to the likes of Tohatsu or Parsun etc.

Equally any opinions on features such as Efi vs. carb, electric start being worthwhile on a smaller capacity engine etc?
Electric start may be useful for SWMBO.

All info or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.🤙",1759086727.0,2,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1nswtpl/outboard_motor_recommendations_8_9hp/

1lpe1l0,sailing,Advice on batteries and solar,"Advice on batteries and solar I have a 100 AH dual-purpose AGM battery on my boat that is about 8 years old and I think is beginning to reach the end of its life.  Used to be I could go out and cruise for a couple of days without getting any shore power, but now by the second day I'm getting ""low power"" warnings on my VHF and it won't crank the electric start on my outboard.  (Not a big deal, I can just pull the cord.)  I think the biggest draw on the boat is my auto-tiller, which I really rely on because I usually single-hand.  Anyway, long story short, I may need to replace it.  When I do, I'm considering also adding some solar panels and a charger, to give me the ability to cruise for longer without having to worry about connecting to shore power.  So... I'm debating whether to replace it with a similar AGM battery, or pay the extra bucks for Lithium.  Saving weight would be nice, since the boat is a small catamaran, but it's not critical.  Also, I've read that Lithium batteries work better with solar, because they are easier to top off that last 10 percent of charge.  Comments?  Suggestions?  Thanks.

Edit: I just realized my ""Xantrex Truecharge2"" charger has no setting for lithium batteries, so I would need to replace that too.  Price tag to switch to lithium just went up another couple of hundred bucks!

Edit: And I've been advised not to connect my 9.9 Yamaha outboard to a LiFePo battery due to risk of damaging the alternator.  I would have to get a DC-DC charger/regulator system (questionable whether this would work) and/or a separate lead-acid battery to connect the outboard to.  Then I'd have to have some way to keep that from going flat if I don't run the motor for a long time.

Edit: So... Bottom line, Lithium would be better, and if I was starting from scratch I'd go that way.  But for my little boat, the way things are, I am just going to plop in a replacement AGM battery and add a little bit of solar for those times when I'm away from shore power for multiple days.",1751405377.0,2,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1lpe1l0/advice_on_batteries_and_solar/
k5yrae,sailing,There I was....,"There I was.... There I was Ladies and Gentleman,

Just me and the Ocean. I'd spent months fixing and cleaning after my initial purchase of a Macgregor 25 that sat unused for 20 years in the high desert of San Bernardino County. I added a Si-Tex AIS 300 system, a brand new Cobra VHF radio, A TV with DVD Combo that runs on12V, a Bluetooth AM/FM sound system. I redid all the electrical, rerouted and plugged in to a brand new UB 121000 Group 27 battery (Which, I must say, I highly recommend.). I bought an 8 person dinghy for a tender, put fuel in my 6 gallon plastic gas tank that runs my 1983 Honda 8HP 4 stoke outboard in which I rebuilt, added new fuel lines, fuel filter, carburetor gaskets, spark plugs, oil, and replaced the entire charging circuit due to mice invasion in the high desert chewing the wires. And there I was. I pulled into, ""Davies Launch Ramp"" in Long Beach, Ca. . I stepped the mast, aired up the dinghy, and set sail. By this time it was late, about 6:30PM, the Sun had set, I was determined though. No other sailboats were on the water, as a matter of fact there was only 1 boat and it was coming in.

&#x200B;

I felt ready, I'd spent all of the last bit of Summer preparing. I got my boat under the bridge as the antennae ting, ting, tinged, across the cross members to the other side. ""Shwew"", I thought, I made it under. 34' read the bridge gauge water level and so I thought I'd better remember that number. That's my limit. Hopefully, on the way in it is no less! I made it to the main Marina center, A bigger open area where, during the daytime, many boats and people enjoying life take place. At this time, no one was around just boats docked and dark along the Picturesque silhouette of Million Dollar Houses that lined the North East drag. I continued left to pass the various dockside restaurants that draw crowds during the average business day. And of course one in particular stands out as the bright signage glows bright red in the night , ""Ballast Point"". Past this is the Channel that leads to the open Ocean.

&#x200B;

This was it, I'd planned, taken sailing classes to get my ASA101, thought about safety, and I was finally doing it. At this point, the wind was at 0, the sea was calm, and it was very dark. Thankfully, there were a few visual aids that I was able to use surrounding me. A line of commercial ships anchored a few miles out of the channel, and several oil rigs that were brightly lit. I motored for a time and was very leery about breaking through the commercial ships line. I was and still am unaware of how they're anchor is done and how long of a lead there may be in the water however, as they were in a line there was no choice but to push through and steer clear of them. I chose the widest spot and went on through. After getting on the other side, everything changed. I could tell that the sea was rolling a bit more and was hearing the splashes of sea life all around me. Dolphins? Maybe. My mainsheet is different from the one I learned with and is located all the way aft underneath the stern pulpit. There are 2 blocks, one on the port, and one on starboard that have springs on them. The port block is where the action happens and has a cam cleat on it. These are tied into another block that attaches to the end of the boom. I did not like the action as it seemed very difficult to loosen or tighten the sheet. But on this night, it did not seem to matter as there was no wind.

&#x200B;

I finally got to a point where I felt safe to raise my main. I did so even though there was 1 KT of wind and I turned off the motor. I spent some time, checking systems, feeling the boat, and making sure my waterline did not change. Being a used boat, I did not want to have some strange problem where I was taking on water. Even though, I'd been over the boat a million times, water is one of those things. Previously when I was on the hard, I used flex seal to seal my cracking scupper and it worked rater well. I just loaded a paint brush with it and shoved it in and turned it about. Made a great seal actually. Now though I recently purchased a new metal scupper, that I plan to install this winter, as well as replace all the hose that is attached to it, and the water tank and such. So there I was, just floating. I did this for hours. At one point, I saw the lights of a ship, they were in a straight line and they were getting closer. I began to become a bit worried as they kept getting closer. I changed course slightly which brought a faster sail but also got me out of the way. As the ship past I was able to recognize it was a cruise line. I enjoyed trying out new things, I mean after all, I was new to all of this and the most I'd ever sailed was in Instruction for 4 days. Just me, my vape rig full of juice, and the Sea.

&#x200B;

All of the sudden my VHF radio called out, ""The Carol Ann, The Carol Ann, The Carol Ann, this is (Some company name) switch to 13. I couldn't believe someone was hailing me. I quickly shot from the cockpit stepped down into the cabin and grabbed the radio. I switched to13 and stated, ""This is the Carol Ann."" The voice came back , ""Yeah, are you underway, I see you are only traveling at about 1KT!"" ""Yes"", I replied, ""I am underway, and under sail."" ""Ok."" The voice answered, ""I'm towing a large barge so I will be passing you at your Port Stern."" ""The Carol Ann Copies Port Stern to pass"", I replied. ""The Carol Ann out"". (""Company out""). I have to admit it tickled me quite a bit to realize that my AIS system must have been working as it should and that I got hailed. I was all stupid giddy about it so get over it. HAHAHA.

&#x200B;

The sky was clear that night. I could see every star and I carefully aimed the bow toward the Moon as it set. Then once it was gone, I aimed toward the brightest star in the same direction. Bobbing, and swaying, I attempted to throw out a line. Maybe I'd catch a fish. Nope. I set my pole on the deck near the cockpit. Then, it occurred to me that it'd be a great time for me to dump my Porto toilet. I leaned over with the bucket and donated my fishing pole to Davies Locker. ""Oh, well."" I thought. As the morning hours drew near the Fog did as well. I could see the plume not coming in to the land, but blasting out toward the sea. I had Fog on my stern, my port and starboard, but ahead was clear. But just like God's hand grabbing at me the Fog engulfed my boat. I was very worried. As the light became brighter, I couldn't believe that I was heading towards the light. This can't be, sun rises in the East, I thought to myself. Hmm. I got my dying phone and looked at Google Maps for reference and indeed I needed to adjust. My goal and target was Catalina Island. As it got brighter visibility was about a mile or so and so, I felt a bit more comfortable. I still had a full tank of gas and as I realized I wasn't moving much I decided to start the motor. Upon, realizing that I had a great run, but was growing tired after staying up all night on watch, I decided to cancel my plans at a Catalina run and head in. I then, turned on the Autopilot and set the motor for 5 KTS and headed back in. I leaned how easy it is to use the Autopilot on the tiller and just set your motor for a particular straight speed.

&#x200B;

So, there I was, the morning sun was up, the Fog broke just as I began to see lots more boat activity around the harbor and I was headed in. Dodging the mess of trap buoys and kelp beds. I actually pulled in my swing keel as to not get trapped in the kelp (One advantage of a swing keel). I got to the dock, lowered the main, put everything away, and loaded my boat on the trailer. So dead tired! So, now   at this point I'm on the 91 freeway headed east back to my estate in Chino Hills when all of the sudden my boat and trailer began swinging wildly behind me. Just as I said, ""Oh, SH$$!"" My boat and trailer was passing me on my left hand side at 65MPH. I couldn't believe it and anyone that saw this had to have been in awe! I quickly chased down the boat and it veered left from my lane all the way to the left lane. Then, it slowly came to a complete stop. Just like that. I parked in front of it, got out with traffic speeding past on both sides and realized the nut came off of the ball, the ball slipped out of the hitch and the chains that I thought were connected were not. A true miracle to one was injured or hurt. A magnificent CHP officer named Adams, came to the rescue. He said, ""You think it'll make it off the freeway if I stop traffic?"" I told him, I did not think I could do it. After all, I just had the ball in the hitch not bolted with a nut. ""Let's give it a try."" ""Ok."" I said. The officer stopped traffic and I slowly pulled the boat off the freeway, Then, he pulled up next to me and said, ""There's a small outlet mall down the road, you can make it there and there is food and a gas station."" So he helped me make it all the way to the outlet mall. I parked the boat and truck, stood the boat on its stand and went to AutoZone for a new ball. Luckily I had a pipe wrench and I tightened the hell out of the nut. I just can't believe what a miracle it is that my boat or anyone else was not affected by the violent swaying of the trailer as it cooked down the freeway.

&#x200B;

Finally I made it safely at home, where I crashed on my bed, my truck and boat parked out front, for all the neighbors to glory at and admonish.

I have a Catana 39ft catamaran  with worn out, 35 year old Volvo 18hp 2002 engines, which I hate, hate, hate.  I have decided to replace them with electric motors, batteries and a generator. The boat weights about 4 tons, has daggerboards, folding props and  tillers, is at the  the performance end of the cruising spectrum. I am considering either replacing the saildrives with 6kw pod motors or taking out the saildrives, closing the holes in the hull and mounting 6kw outboards in a similar way to how Seawind or TRT catamarans mount outboards as hopefully the boat would be faster and I could use one of the electric outboards on my dinghy when at anchor and one could work as a hydrogenator while sailing. I will add 400ah of 48v batteries, which should give 8 hours at  6 knots , a 60-80km range.   If I don't use a generator  I could save about 200kg over diesels and my 15hp outboard. With a 5kw generator  the total weight will stay about  the same, I could really use the exrtra space of the engine rooms for storage and a shower as interior space is small for a almost 40 foot catamaran.",1742501790.0,12,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1jfyg34/speed_difference_saildrives_vs_outboards/

1me2vr7,sailing,Hybrid (electric) Sailing,"Hybrid (electric) Sailing I have a 20', 3000#, full keel, lead ballasted sloop that lives on a mooring. For the past 10 years or so I've experimented with electric auxiliary drive power (after giving up on a couple of outboards). I started with a single 12v, 100ah lead-acid battery and a 55# thrust trolling motor, charging with 2, 45W solar panels. It worked well enough, but was marginal speed wise. I upgraded to 2 batteries and a 24v, 90# thrust motor, much better. Finally, now that prices have come down, I've gone to 4, 100ah lithium batteries, and 2, 100w panels. The new battery bank is 100# vs 150# for l-a, twice the storage, and much more usable range because you can fully discharge lithium. 

All this was originally to make docking and mooring pickup easier and getting in/out of the harbor in light winds. I'm a day sailor, so time is precious. Now, with 5kw-h, I can run for several hours, which is nice. What I hadn't expected (hence the title) was how interesting using wind+electric was sailing in light air. It reminds me very much of riding an electric assisted bike, which just makes it feel like your legs are stronger, in this case just making the boat feel like there's more wind than there actually is. With no noise or smell it just feels like sailing. 

Since I strictly day sail, usually once a week, my batteries get charged between sails. The panels I'm using are 3# flexible ones that I bend over the boom. We'll see how long they last, but they're so cheap now replacing every few years wouldn't be a problem. I'm still running trolling motors because I mount on a high transom, and I like to raise it out of the water when really sailing.",1753971642.0,11,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1me2vr7/hybrid_electric_sailing/

1dct2k6,sailing,Convince me not to buy this boat please.,"Convince me not to buy this boat please. Hello all,

Been sailing for a few years, just moved to a remote city on a coastline and im currently in the market for a sailboat. Looking for a boat able to do some coastal sailing and the occasionnal weekend trip.

As im in a small community, only a few marina slips are available and they are all taken. The waiting list for it is more than 3 years.

As of now, the only sailboat for sale with a slip (and one of the only sailboat at the marina) is a Beneteau 381 Clipper 1998 that the current owners are willing to sell.

The asking price is about 80k$ (CAD)

As of previous history of the boat, it had been a charter sailboat on Champlain Lake from 1998-2011, then moved to the town im in (salty water from then). Maintenance records are pretty spotty from the charter period, but all I know is :

* Original yanmar 54hp engine (2500hrs)
* Original standing rigging
* Original instruments
* Original sails (1 main, 1 genoa 130 + 1 jib, a spi that has been sitting and has been partly eaten up by rats)
* Winterizing was not up to Beneteau recommendations from 1998-2020 (only drained the engine with no antifreeze)

For the maintenance by the current owner and current state of the boat :

* No real improvement to the boat since original
* No real engine maintenance records (not a single fuel filter change in 13 years)
* Original running rigging
* Antifoul paint from 3 years ago
* Been sitting on the hard for 2 years with the sails on and without any maintenance
* Depth/speed sounders not working, tach not working
* Various electrical issues
* Inflatable dighy is leaking and gas outboard engine not starting
* Yanmar diesel engine starts over easily and seems to be working fine, no shaft play, no vibration, but there is rust all over the front cover and alternator
* No real issue with the hull to my eye
* Standing rigging seems to be in good shape, no rust and no cracks to my eye
* Some delamination on the rudder and slight play at the bearing.
* Bilge is bone dry, some surface rust on keel bolts, current owner states that bilg pump might be obstructed/defective

I know its quite a list, but I really wanted to hear some opinions.

In my eye, it seems to be a solid base, but with many projects to tackle to make this ship sea-worthy

I have an accredited marine inspector coming in this week for inspection, but I wont be able to have a certified marine mechanic take a look at the engine as im too far remote for anyone to come and take a look (I tried...).

Im quite resourceful for DIY, know my way around gas engine (not diesel as of yet) and willing to take on a project/challenge. However, am I getting myself in trouble here? Will I be left stranded with a huge useless paperweight? How would you price this boat? Would you be willing to take on this kind of project yourself?

As a sailor that does not need to be anywhere on a time schedule I don't plan on using the engine for anything other than getting in and out of a slip, or assist with getting up against a dock. Or get offshore when the wind is against me. (So, whatever it is it will need power).

1febcxp,sailing,Considering my first sailboat - Based in WI and want something for weekending on Lake Michigan,"Considering my first sailboat - Based in WI and want something for weekending on Lake Michigan Hello /r/sailing! 

I'm beginning to look hard at getting a sailboat.  I've taken the ASA101 and have the 103/104 scheduled for this winter.  I'm new to sailing, but been boating all my life (did my WI Boater Safety 30+ years ago when I was 11).  I've owned 5 different boats, the largest being a 95 Sea Ray 250 that I ran on Lake Mendota, and these days I just have a 24' pontoon at my vacation rental in the north woods.  

I'm wanting to start the search for a boat that I can keep in Port Washington for weekends and short vacations.  My family lives in Port (I don't), so it's a good spot for us to be based out of.  I'd like to be in the 26-36' range so there's at least enough room for my wife and I to overnight and maybe 1-2 other people (likely my 10 y/o niece and/or her dad/my brother).

Budget is going to be no more than ~$60k, but that needs to include any major updates or new rigging or sails or engine work.  I'm more concerned with ease of maintenance and low-drama than creature comforts.  Straight forward sail inventory, usable electronics, and enough tankage that we can get by for a long weekend.

I see lots of Hunter's and Catalina's out there, and those seems like good makes to target in this area. I expect parts won't be too tough to get and there's probably a decent amount of local-expertise if I need to outsource work.  

My main goal, other than enjoying being on the water, is meaningful experience to enable us to be able to do bareboat charters in the BVI and Bahamas. We want to make sure we have a boat large enough to allow for that.  I realize size isn't the biggest issue, but obviously having larger vessels on my sailing resume is, all things being equal, better than just skiffs and sub 20' craft.  Wife and I are both really interested in this kind of vacationing, and are building toward that.

I'm comfortable with the notion that I'm going to have to have a marina pull the boat out in fall to get it stored for winter, so I don't need it to be trailer-able, and even if it was, I don't have access to anything that can tow >8000lbs.

I really just want enough room for 4 people to stay on it for a couple nights, enough length and size to have the experience be somewhat transferable to a larger charter boat, and common enough that I won't be pulling my (rapidly disappearing) hair out or spending exorbitant amounts (>$10k) of money on it.   

I'm pretty decent at engine maintenance (I've owned stern-drives, jet drives and outboards and did all my own maintenance) and have done lots of electrical work on boats.  I also blew up an engine on my jet-drive boat, so i know the kind of pain one can experience, financially, when it comes to a boat.

Thanks in advance!",1726064527.0,9,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1febcxp/considering_my_first_sailboat_based_in_wi_and/
183yd95,sailing,Starting from scratch with electricity on O’Day 25,"Starting from scratch with electricity on O’Day 25 Bought an O’Day 25 for peanuts this summer. It’s been great. 

There is no battery on board. The outboard is a pull start (there are connectors for a battery). There is a 12v panel which I’ve never tested. 

The boat came with a little West Marine running light suction thing which I’ve never used. 

The boat is sailed on a lake, 1-2 overnights a year and occasional sailing home in the dark. 

I have shore power in my slip. 

So, now that it’s winter I’m thinking about electricity. 

I really only need running lights, a masthead light, a cabin light and some music. 

While I’d love an electric start for the engine, I don’t think I can retrofit it and I don’t hate the pull start enough to buy a new motor. 

So, should I buy a battery to see if the wiring for lights works or should I just keep everything battery powered. 

I’m heavily invested in Milwaukee’s M12 and M18 so I have lights (and a fan) and I could buy a solar powered masthead light for when I need it and some sort of waterproof rechargeable stereo.

The hatch over my boat’s outboard well was removed by the previous owner to fit a newer engine. I’ve recently upgraded in turn to a tiny electric outboard so now the old hatch fits with room to spare. I have the old hatch, but not the hinges. 🙃

I can see from the outline of where the hinges were that they’re just like all the other cockpit hinges (see picture) - 3 1/8th long x 2 5/8th wide, oddly shaped, dark metal (bronze?), and importantly **with rounded edges so you don’t snag things on them when sliding / walking around the cockpit**

In a perfect world, I’d love to find two more of the same hinges, but the boat is from the 80’s (Rob Roy 23, Marine Concepts) and Google Lense hasn’t been any help. If anyone has a lead, I’d be eternally grateful

In the world we live in, I’ve been browsing the usual boating hardware sites for boat hinges, but all I can find is stuff that looks like it’s supposed to be hidden under hatches, or between doors and jams. The closest I’ve found is something like these from WM https://www.westmarine.com/west-marine-heavy-duty-stainless-steel-butt-hinge-2inch-open-width-x-2inch-length-7219603.html

But they still look quite sharp around the edges. I’ve tried searching for “boat hatch hinges with rounded edges” and come up empty handed - I get door hinges with rounded corners. Is there a specific piece of terminology I’m missing? Is there some corner of the internet for oldschool sailboat hardware I’m not familiar with?

16vpdec,sailing,Small electric motor placement on Sailing tender?,"Small electric motor placement on Sailing tender? Hello everybody thank you for stopping by to read this from your local novice-overthinking sailor. I am really getting into sailing and I want to practice my skills a lot and hopefully get my kids involved now that I feel confident in my skills enough to take them out. However, I am not a huge fan of the boats that are available for rent in the area. I live in northern Virginia, so the Potomac River is the best body of water I can access. This means that I am mostly limited to sailing crafts that are less than 22' and as a ""Personal opinion"" most of the options are not to my liking. I really want a simple boat that can fit my family to give us the fun basics of sailing and getting us on the water together.  


Looking through the depths of the internet I came across [Chesapeake Light craft and their Lake Union](https://www.clcboats.com/shop/boats/pro-kits/lake-union-swift.html)[ swift boat kits](https://www.clcboats.com/shop/boats/pro-kits/lake-union-swift.html). I thought this was absolutely perfect not only because of the full-length benches and simple design but also fell in love with the idea of building the boat together as a family and making sailing a family event.

&#x200B;

However, the one thing about having this as my main sailboat is a real scenario on the Patomic River: the current being more powerful than the wind. I didn't want to have a relatively large outboard engine on the boat and I didn't want to have to deal with the added bulky problems such as tanks and the added complexity of figuring out where or what to do with it while I was sailing to reduce drag.

&#x200B;

As an overthinker, I soon came up with the idea of somehow mounting an electric motor on the sailing tender which could be used if the scenario arises. A motor mixed with folding propellers would be a perfect way to have something small and tucked away if the event requires it. 

&#x200B;

However, as an extremely novice sailor, i have no idea what would be the best design. I have come up with three different sketches and plans but I want to know from all of you how idiotic my plans are:

* Option 1: Have a Folding propeller mounted on the back side of the rudder. I feel this is the simplest solution because it is the least invasive to the original design of the boat, it would only require removing a small rectangle, mounting the motor, and adding some flair for hydrodynamics. This would allow the rudder to also function as the thrust vectoring so that way there doesn't have to be anything extra.
   * My biggest question/concern with this idea is; would the propeller have too much force exerted on it by the forces that act on the rudder? would those forces try to rip the motor off sideways or at least rip the propellers off since it would be a folding prop and stick out far past the intended rudder?

[Option 1: Motor mounted on rudder](https://preview.redd.it/8kar5j2es9rb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d971e79390401a0156c52a4c7dd33852536f420)

&#x200B;

* Option 2: having a single motor mounted on the center line like an inboard motor. This would be a good option because it is similar to every existing sailboat today, but the problem I have with this is that this option would result in the most dramatic alteration of the original design because i would have to carve out a large area of the rudder to accommodate the propeller which could result in a loss of performance.

[Option 2, a single motor, like an inboard.](https://preview.redd.it/10azjd3as9rb1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1e1d23f1ead7dc6e6770ab0885c1d82381c04c7)

&#x200B;

* Option 3: Have two motors mounted underneath the boat on either side of the rudder's travel. This would be the ""safest"" option for battling current but it would double the costs because I would have to get 2 motors, and extra batteries, and it would add complexity to the electrical setup. This wouldn't be too difficult to attach to the boat because it would likely only require two hydrodynamic pods that would house the motors. the

I am trying to decide between dirt cheap, but solid and more expensive but a dream boat of sorts. 

*The decision*:

1986 30 Foot yacht 

* All fibreglass - immaculately maintained
* Has everything I am looking for, and the kicker - I missed out on buying it in December but the new owner is leaving the country and now it's back up for sale
* 2017 Lombardi 20hp deisel 
* New furling Genoa, excellent condition for the rest of the sails
* Electric cockpit controlled windlass
* All the electronics - GPS, NAV, VHF, Chart-plotter, depth sounder, etc. 
* Bimini with full tent, Davit w/ fibreglass dinghy, swim platform, etc
* Electric head with macerator and holding tank, great galley with fridge, freezer, stove, etc.
* Other things I like: Deep closed cockpit, rigged for shorthanded sailing, traveler in front of cockpit. 

*Verses*

1970 30 Foot yacht 

* Fibreglass over ply - but re-glassed in the last 2 years
* All new rigging, sheets, and ropes
* All new deck hardware
* Mercury 15hp outboard
* Sails are OK for cruising but will need to be replaced in a couple years
* Traveler is behind the tiller (not my favourite place)
* Bimini, but pretty old and worn out
* Older electrical system with some electronics - GPS, Depth-sounder
* Davit and dinghy included
* Interior is clean but unfinished - galley need to be completed, needs new squabs, but lots of headroom
* Manual head, no holding tank

The price difference is the big thing. The first is about $40k and the other is $9k - so with a $31K difference, do I pay more for the one I am drooling over or save a lot of money and get the one that is solid, but needs a bit more work to be perfect.

Note - it's not totally about the money, I won't go bankrupt either way. I already know I will be shelling out cash for years to come in either case, but there are enough boxes checked on the 'cheaper' boat that it's making the decision harder.

ebi7sj,sailing,Couple Questions from a Self-Taught Beginner,"Couple Questions from a Self-Taught Beginner Hello all,

I've recently bought a 23ft Pearson (fin keel) and I've been sailing it frequently (\~2x weekly). I have some questions.  

1st off, safety questions. The boat has a 2015 Tohatsu outboard. It's a pretty good motor as far as I can tell, but I don't trust outboards. I want at least one more method of propulsion. The boat weighs \~3000lb. Do yall think rowing a boat of this size is reasonable? Also, I've considered getting a \~80lb trolling motor. I can get to within \~200 meters of my slip under sail, so I think a trolling motor could get me in. Anyone have an electric backup motor?  

Secondly, who do you call for a tow? My general plan was to just call the marina (phone) or radio on ch 16. Is this the right way? I have tow insurance through boatUS.  

Downwind  sailing feels weird, but I haven't flown my spinnaker yet. It makes me nervous because I don't know how to hoist/lower it. There are two halyards on my mast, so I think I attach the top of the spinnaker to my second halyard, and then the sides to the far back pulleys in my cockpit, then just... cleat it? That seems dangerous. Untying the cleats while the spinnaker is under load also seems dangerous. The tutorials I've seen use a pole, which I don't have.  

There are little metal things in my main sail (battens, right?). How do I use these?  

Both the mainsheet and the vang pull down on the mainsail. I understand the vang is to adjust ""twist"". I used this to make the top of the sail at a higher angle than the bottom when on a broad reach. I think this is the correct use? I don't have a way to accurately measure my speed.

lzdgkj,sailing,Day sailing with only an electric trolling motor for getting in and out of marina,"Day sailing with only an electric trolling motor for getting in and out of marina I sail a 28-ft full-keel 8,000 lb sloop on the San Francisco Bay and right now my only motor is a Newport 24V 86 lb thrust electric trolling motor. It mostly works to very slowly get us out of the marina channel and back in again. I say mostly because the other day, with winds blowing into the channel at 9mph, I lost rudder control trying to motor out and almost got blown into the shallows, simply because the trolling motor was no match for wind pressure against the boat's hull. I was able to take advantage of the pirouette momentum and motor with the wind back into the marina, and I probably could've raised the mainsail and powered out of the situation as well. But the experience left me wanting more power. 

A sailboat of my size should have a 15HP outboard motor in its lazerette, by the conventional charts, but the previous owner got by with a 4HP motor which was much easier to pull out when not in use. That motor was 20-years old and done by the time I acquired the boat, so I replaced it with the itty bitty Newport trolling motor as an experiment. 

I don't want to go back to internal combustion for power. Torqeedo and Epropulsion make powerful trolling motors and charge thousands of dollars for them. Haswing just came out last year with a sub-$1,000 5HP model, but I can find no review information on it. (I just posted a related question to r/boating seeking input on the Haswing, figuring pontoon boaters etc are far more likely to have used one.)

TLDR: I'd like to know what experience other day sailors of medium size boats have with the more powerful electric trolling motors. I'm particularly interested in the Haswing 5HP model for cost and specs.",1615071738.0,8,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/lzdgkj/day_sailing_with_only_an_electric_trolling_motor/

So far working well, it's a little rough, but seems to sail nicely, was quite a learning experience putting the mast up the first time. 

Not the most familiar with nautical terms, but I am looking to take a longer voyage across the great lakes later this summer. I have most of the required/recommended safety gear, but I am currently in the middle of renovating the inside, I basically gutted the whole thing and am in the process of redoing the interior, not fancy, just clean and comfortable.

BTW the safety gear I have is:

1) Throwable life preserver

2) Life jacket Type1?

3) Fire extinguisher B-1

4) Flares

Do I need a horn?

Just trying to keep the boat stripped down as possible.

Plan on sailing with 

\-30 days of food/rations.

\-Solar panels/inverter/batteries

\-Electric outboard (I have a 75lb trolling motor that works pretty well and pushes the boat along nicely, but will probably get a bigger one)

\-Fishing rod/tackle

\-Books

\-Cell phone

\-Bed

\-Fan

\-Sewing kit for sails

\-Repair epoxy for random repairs

Not really sure what else I might need, I'm pretty comfortable with music, books, and a fishing rod.

tganmx,sailing,Buying a Small Daysailer,"Buying a Small Daysailer Hey all,

I'm a newbie who did some sailing in my childhood and teens. Now, I'm looking into buying a small daysailer to sail around coastal waters near where I live. My father had a Rhodes 19 when he was younger so I'll be working with him and some sailer friends to get to the point where I know what I'm doing.

I'm currently talking to someone about purchasing either a Rhodes 19 or Mercury 15, and leaning towards the Rhodes since my sense is that it's a safer, better boat that will give me more options in terms of range once I've learned the ropes (lines?).

I'd love to hear your thoughts on a couple of questions.

My first is on outboard motors. None of the Rhodes 19s I see in pictures have outboards, but I've read about people hitting trouble when the didn't have one and the wind dies. Is it a bad idea have one? Dangerous not to? Looking into it, it seems like a 4hp outboard would do the trick for a Rhodes, given the 500lb per HP rule I've seen sighted.

My second is on keel vs. centerboard in a Rhodes 19. The centerboard boat looks like it would be easier to transport, store, and get in and out of the water. How much of a difference does the keel make in stability?

Thank you all so much, and feel free to throw in any advice that might be helpful!",1647524896.0,22,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/tganmx/buying_a_small_daysailer/

I’m looking at purchasing a Daysailer over the next couple months and I’m just researching additional components I might need, one of them being an outboard. Initially, I was going to look at getting a 2 to 4 hp gas outboard like my old Capri had however, with the rise of electric propulsion as well as it’s decreasing costs, I thought it might be better to just get an electric outboard. I have some concerns regarding the power as I’m looking for something that can push a 500 lbs daysailer in and out of mooring as well as propel it towards the coast in case of sudden bad weather or an onboard emergency which needs me to get to land quickly. I was looking to see what would be ideal and some YouTube videos I have researched thus far have shown that 36 lbs thrust seems to work well with smaller boats. When I was watching the videos however, it seems that the motors were a little under powered so I’m just wondering what would be best to go for if I was looking to get similar propulsion to a small outboard gas engine as mentioned at the top of my post.

wv03pt,sailing,Where to mount outboard on 1-rail stern pulpit + which outboard,"Where to mount outboard on 1-rail stern pulpit + which outboard Hey,

I'm buying a small outboard (\~2.5hp) and I need a place to mount it while cruising. I've seen the Edson mounts but my stern pulpit only has a top rail and therefore isn't compatible. I've included a photo below (sorry for the odd photo, it's the only one I have.)

My second question is which outboard to get. I have the West Marine RU-250 roll-up dinghy and it's pretty much a non-planing dinghy due to its keel-less design although I weigh 130 so I might be able to plane it with just myself. My main consideration is weight as I have to hand down the outboard to someone on the dinghy, which seems impossible with over 40 pounds. It's pretty much between the Suzuki 2.5 and Honda 2.3 and I'm leaning towards the quieter, water-cooled, cheaper, and lighter Suzuki but I could be easily persuaded. Also if I get a good enough argument I might spend $1500 on a used electric outboard.

rahwg5,sailing,DIY Canoe Sailing Build Tips *Looking For*,"DIY Canoe Sailing Build Tips *Looking For* Hello all! I have an old 17 ft aluminum Grumman canoe that I'm planning on (more like dreaming about) building amas to make it a trimaran. To start, I may get a gas outboard and/or electric trolling motor, but I'd really like to have a modular setup for sailing. I live near many windy lakes and rivers, but not intending for Ocean cruising. I'm hoping with this post I can reach people who have done the same or are looking to do the same and maybe have some ideas or experience they'd like to share. 

Some questions I have are:

\- Are sailing kits a good way to go? Am I saving money buying a kit, or are there reliable places I can buy parts for individually like the sail, mast + boom, pullies/rope locks among all other things needed for sailing? Do the kits allow for much customizing? (sorry for my lack of proper terminology, I'm slowly learning through youtube tutorials)

\*Links to kits AND separate parts encouraged\*

\- Has anyone made amas from scratch? What is the best material? The results I'm looking for is to have the canoe completely stabilized and for the amas/pontoons to at least slightly increase the weight capacity of the boat. I've read there are amas that are submersible and non-submersible. 

\- There seems to be multiple styles of sails and wondering what the best type would be for my craft? I've seen some on smaller boats that looked like an old Junk Ship, but also the classic triangular sail. I'm a bit of a speed demon, so I'd love something that can deliver some good speed in the right conditions. Assuming size and style of the sail could have a lot to do when factoring in for speed.

And lastly (for now):

\-Any tips on rope (sheet?) management for someone looking to sail solo (or be solely responsible for the function of the craft). I can't seem to find the video now, but someone had a wood panel with several different locking systems for the different ropes and wondered if everything can be managed from one position?

Anyways, thank you in advanced to anyone with some useful information and hope we can have a fun discussion on some cool ideas for sailing a canoe!",1638825215.0,6,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/rahwg5/diy_canoe_sailing_build_tips_looking_for/

I've been looking into getting sailing lessons but haven't had very much luck yet (also, I'm a teenager, which makes things harder). I have watched a ton of YouTube videos, which have done a decent bit of good. I've also been looking at some for-sale listings for boats online... mostly Catalina 27's and the like for under $2k.

Then I recently found a Columbia T-23... listed for free. It was manufactured in 1974 but it has a 2012 engine. From the listing: *"" The boat and motor are free because the current owner must relinquish slip and does not wish to continue sailing as a hobby. The motor is a 2012 Tohatsu outboard with electric start. The motor is in very good condition. The boat is ready to motor or sail away, or be towed if the person who acquires the boat has a trailer. The owner does not have a trailer. The boat is in good shape and seaworthy. Sails include the mainsail and jib. The cabin is very clean and includes seats, v-berth for sleeping, Force 10 heater, portable toilet, and wash basin. ""*

Of course, there's a chance that this could be a scam, but from the listing's appearance, I'm inclined not to think so. There are 3 images and they seem legit.

I live maybe an hour or two away from this boat. I don't have a trailer, though. And I don't think I know enough to just... *sail* it away.

It was just listed two days ago so no one's pounced on it yet... but I don't know how long that'll last. Would this boat be good for a beginner? (It is pretty small, 23ft) And should I reach out to the owner?

I have a 1974 Ericson Pleasure (29 feet) that's been in Marina del Rey (CA) for some time. Maybe her whole life!. She's a great boat and I've taken good care of her for 3.5 years. I bought the boat used and the hull is great, sails are great, and most everything in good shape. Of course things break here and there but it's fun to work on.

The biggest headache though has been the Atomic 4 engine. I feel like I've replaced every component of it and while it's been running decently lately, I'm always worried it will break any time. Most importantly, it prevents me from doing fun long-distance trips even though I have the equipment to do so. The last repairman found that the water pump had been broken for some time and burnt out (?) higher gears (?). With a new water pump and oil, it works but I can only use it slowly, which makes it less fun to take out given how big our marina is and how often you need to motor-sail to get somewhere.

Searching for advice on how to replace this Atomic 4. Would love everyone's feedback:

1) Buy a ""new"" Atomic 4 (i.e., rebuilt with good parts) and install? I know they don't Atomic 4s anymore.

2) True new engine. If so, what type/model? Is electrical a possibility without huge batteries? Gas or diesel if not? I've read nightmare stories about not getting diesel or gas and both sides argue hard.

3) Outboard engine? I dont have anywhere to easily install it but maybe there are hacks around that? Certainly easier to repair. Not sure it would go fast enough. There is no open hatch on the stern like on smaller sailboats I've been on.

I'm not the most handy with engines so while I'm willing to pay someone or learn to maintain a new engine, it's hard for me to know something is wrong until it's too late.

68cjph,sailing,Help choosing a new outboard for our Columbia 28 sailboat.,"Help choosing a new outboard for our Columbia 28 sailboat. A (hopefully brief) backstory: Quite some time ago, my father bought a Columbia 28 he found on craigslist which seemed like a great deal at the time. Obviously it needed a little TLC, and before long we were out among the SF bay waves. Fixing her up has been mostly cosmetic, but still a learning experience. One thing we did need to buy was a new outboard, and we learned about the different shaft lengths the hard way. The motor worked, but in higher swells the  prop would come completely out of the water at times. Also, everyone had to be sitting at the very back of the boat if we were traveling under power. These were things that were semi-annoying, but not worth buying a new motor kind of annoying.

Well, fast forward to 6 months ago and apparently the way we had been docking the boat came to the attention of some thieves. They motored into the marina in a small boat under cover of dark one night and took our motor since there was easier access from the dock (plus it didn't have a lock). We had been backing into our slip for a while because it was much easier to flush the motor from the dock, as the flush valve was basically on top of the water intake. 

Finally we are in the market for a new outboard and do not want to make any further mistakes choosing the right tool for the job, as it were. Originally we were thinking 15hp models, although somebody my father spoke to at a local boat store introduced him to a 4-stroke Yamaha 9.9hp with electric start and something called power thrust or high-thrust or something like that, which we think will hopefully work in conjunction with the extra long shaft to cover our previous power issues. Another benefit is that it can be flushed from the top, unlike the one we bought used. We are also planning on buying a lock for it, but I'm not yet familiar with those types of lock and which is more secure.
Anyway, this is the one we seem to have narrowed it down to, but I wanted to first try and get some more opinions on whether this is the right choice, if it probably has enough power, or if anybody has any insight from their own experiences. I would just hate to be left wanting after all is said and done.

there will be 8 remote control outlet valves that can vary the output flow.   each of the outputs goes to a hose .. 2 to the transom for forward thrust..  one to each side of the stern for rear side steering.. one to each side of the bow for bow steering and a second pair up front that face forward for reverse thrust.   this gives you full maneuvering with probably either electric control powered by a sealed PM alternator ring on the diesel power head or shaft or some kind of hydraulic also from the diesel power head.. 

the thru hull outlet fittings would be self closing with either a flap that opens with a hidden spring loaded hinge when pressure is applied or some kind of pressure retracted plug much like a diesel injector pintle.  this could probably be done with 1"" hose for the sides and bow..  and i would probably want larger to the 2 for the transom outlets so you could use it to get around in the harbor at 5 knots.  or faster out of the harbor..  but hose and flow rates would need to be calculated for the size of your boat.  one could even just use a PWC motor and impeller set up since they are fuel injected there is less chance of fuel vapors in the bilge.  the reason i like diesel.

3uiahx,sailing,What is the most high-tech marine engine you know of for a sailboat?,"What is the most high-tech marine engine you know of for a sailboat? The other day I foolishly asked about modern gasoline engines which generated yet another discussion on diesel vs gasoline.

I realize now this was the wrong question. What I actually want to know is what is the most modern super-duper high tech marine engine you know of that is suitable for a sailboat, as opposed to some 800hp outboard monster.

Most of the sailboats I've ever been on have been 30, 40, or more years old, often with their original engines. The few brand spanking new engines I've seen have looked surprisingly similar to their 30 or 40 year old counterparts, other then their shiny new paint.  In fact, most new marine engines seem to have about the same performance as a fully rebuilt & properly tuned 30+ year old engine of the ""same"" make/model size.

The new paint & treatment options certainly help a great deal in preventing rust, as does synthetic oil does for wear, and a modern solenoid & starter makes a world of difference, but I'd love to see some examples of really big changes, as we have seen in the car engines of 2015 vs 1975.

I'm purchasing an outboard for my 8'3"" West Marine RU-250 but I'd like some opinions for the outboard. Mostly for ship-to-shore and exploring lakes near me.

I'm thinking of getting a 5hp (the max rated hp) probably from Tohatsu for their reliability, ease, and moderate price. I'd love for it to plane for best performance. Would propane be a good idea? Seems more complicated to store on my 20'sailboat but I like the environmental part of it and less maintenance (at least claimed by the company itself). Electric is great but way over my budget.

I'll probably just end up with a Tohatsu 5hp 4-stroke gas but would love to hear thoughts :)",1650217431.0,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/u5s4sj/outboard_for_ru250_west_marine/

Its a 1986 Aft-Cabin, and looks to have been ordered without an engine? Still trying to figure that out.  Will pull out of water very soon. Its sat for three years docked, but the PO bought new sails.  While its not my dream yacht, its one step closer! 

Because its situated on the Tennessee river, I'll need good motoring range going to the coast and back.  For this reason, and because its only supplied with a 15HP outboard, I am strongly considering an electrical conversion. I am also thinking about the next owner, and considering a diesel genset, with electric propulsion.  All electric does appeal to me, and I am confident and experienced with electrical installations (its my job) so wiring 12-48v DC/AC systems is no problem for me.  

First, time to learn to be a better boater, and sailor. 

Things I know it needs checked: 

* Anchor rode
* Bow roller
* Jib furler
* Rigging, turnbuckles (I would LOVE to replace with Dyneema)
* Sheets, Lines, and Halyards are DIRTY (Sat for 3 years)
* Wenchs probably need servce
* Bilge pump (replace?) \[someone stole the electric lines, and rainwater collected, has since been cleaned and dried\]
* Check/replace throughhulls

Things I know need replaced: 

* bottom paint
* Zincs
* Probably needs and electrical overhaul
* Head plumbing
* Cushions are sad 

Other work:

* Wipe and disinfect with vinegar or other solution on interoir
* Pressure wash and clean cockpit/hull with Oxylic acid 
* Oil all Teak
* Install amidship cleets

Goals: 

* Convert to electric drive? (Currently outboard only)
* Install diesel/electric system for future owner instead of all electric? 
* Install new electronics
* Install heater
* Install tiller autopilot (will a windvain work with tiller?)
* Increase water storage
* Acquire Asymetrical Spinnaker
* Sail to Caymans.",1611002237.0,12,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/l037h8/just_bought_a_newport_273_first_boat/

Ok - building my friend an electric cruiser boat out of my old sailboat. the boat is a Coronado 25' - I had been out of the country over a year and this boat was sitting languishing at the marina. 

our plan was to remove the mast entirely, haul it out for a new bottom coat, and fix the tiller handle which seemed to have broken from waves + a bad tie up. He bought a really nice torqeedo 8 or 10 HP 48v electric motor system and battery bank. so mind you, friend has no plans to sail thing thing ever. will always run on electric outboard.

so we tow it to the boatyard and have it hauled out only to discover the tiller isn't the just missing, the entire RUDDER is missing, which explains why the tiller fell off. 

so - do I have some kind of replacement put on / made / ordered? or is it possible to just completely skip it, (I highly doubt there are any leaks, seems to have been missing a long time now and is fine, but we'd check) and just let him use the motor tiller to steer entirely?

4j3r74,sailing,Need help determining outboard size on Bristol 27,"Need help determining outboard size on Bristol 27 Hey everyone! 

I have a Bristol 27 which is located in Everett WA, just north of Seattle. We are currently in a bit of a dilema in regards to our engine. 

It came with a 15hp Merc outboard 2 stroke that was running on one cylinder due to bad ignition coil + spark plug boot was non-existant. It also has low compression in one cylinder as well. The carb was fouled up and the zinc was completely corroded(trying to remove the bolt caused it to snap). We decided that we'd rebuild the carb, replace ignition coils and water pump and use it as it. Well due to low compression, tuning it is a giant PITA, so the engine is on CL for sale.

The inboard Perkins M20 diesel(18hp) was seized and the owner had pretty much just kept it there without doing anything with it. We recently pulled the diesel and found that not only the pistons were frozen in place, but the crank had been severly ground down and cracks were present. 

The boat is a full keel boat, with a displacement of 6,600lbs. I am looking at getting one of them new 4 stroke outboards, however I thought i'd reach out to the community to see what you have to say!

Since our displacement is 6.6k lbs, I was looking at a Mercury 9.9hp 4 stroke with the ""command thrust"" lower end(extra long shaft) which is a 2.42:1 gear ratio and a 4 blade high thrust prop. I would opt for the NON electric start/tilt option to save weight and money, however the cost would be around $2500 and the weight is roughly 99lbs based on onlineoutboards.com

Our current 15hp merc is roughly 75lbs, so the new one is roughly 25lbs heavier(i will beef up the transom to support the weight). 

Being raised in the Fiji islands I've never had to deal with the ebb & flow of the tides. Would a 9.9 high thrust engine be able to push a boat of my size against a current of 4-5knots? I dont want to get into a situation that could be potentially dangerous to me and anyone aboard the boat. 

I've looked at inboards, but the cost of one is jsut too great, and i dont expect to keep this boat for ever. However in the event that I do keep it(will determine in 2-5 years from now), I will then look to add in a diesel or possibly electric, however right now, i think for cost vrs convenience continuing with an outboard is probably worth it.

Hi guys, my wife and I just purchased an '82 Catalina 25 in very good mechanical condition overall.  Gel coat looks pretty good all over it other than being dirty, no notable interior water damage, newer sails, like new race rigging, new LP outboard.  The interior, however, is all original and we plan to modernize it.  The boat was very well taken care of and has only had two owners.  The last owner got sick last year so its sat collecting spiders since then.

&#x200B;

As we embark on this project we have a few questions we would like to get opinions on from those with more experience.  We appreciate your input!

&#x200B;

\-First step is giving the entire boat a good scrub down, what solution do you recommend thats powerful but safe for water use?

\-All the teak is aged and faded, how should we bring this back to life?  I have heard you need to be very specific with oil and you do not want to seal it in any way as it holds water then.

\-The boat has some electrical issues and is all original wiring system.  Has a single batter as well as 220 outlet for shore power.  I am thinking I may want to just rewire the majority of this and put a new panel in, however we are not all that knowledgable on this, any good resources to guide us through such a job?

\-The boat has a bathroom sink and kitchen.  Bathroom pumps fine but the kitchen won't pump.  Not sure if its an air leak in the line or the little pump itself, any tips on how to narrow this down?

\-A few windows show signs of a very slight leak, whats the best way of sealing these?

\-Previous owner put boat carpet down in the interior, we would like to replace this right away.  Any tips on what we should put down that is durable, good in marine environment, and looks clean but reasonably priced?

\-The manual bilge pump does not seem to work, looks like its all dried out and needs rebuilt.  Does anyone make rebuild kits for these?

\-The sail cover has a rip in it right at the winch, the bimini cover does as well, both about 6"" long, whats a good patch or fix for these that we could do ourselves?

\-The boat has an original Princess Alcohol stove that has not been used in probably 10 years.  Is this worth cleaning up and saving or is there cheap replacements that look more modern?  We will be staying on this for a few days at a time when we use it so we would like a stove to cook on.

Those are our current pressing matters.  We appreciate everyone's input on these or anything else you think we should know at this early stage!",1562520984.0,3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/ca9gyz/just_bought_our_first_boat_my_list_of_newbie/
6w6n5n,sailing,120VAC Shorepower install questions,"120VAC Shorepower install questions I'm in Houston, TX and bought a 1976 Ericson 25 sailboat one week before Hurrican Harvey came billowing along. Harvey's an a-hole. The outboard motor didn't idle when I bought her; the carburetor needed a quick cleaning and I added a couple of fuel filters to keep it clean. The engine hums like a choir now.

Anyway, she's kept in a marina and she's never had an AC system for battery charging or bilge pump. The previous owners just ran an orange extension cord from the dock to the companion way and then to a power strip inside. This seems unacceptable to me.

I'd like to install a three circuit AC system for a dual battery charger (10 Amp max) that feeds the two batteries (2 12V deep cycle batteries), an outlet for air conditioning (~5 amps max) & other small load (like a laptop charger and/or lamp, less than 5 amps max), and an automatic bilge pump in case the boat gets water inside it. The bilge pump would be about 2 Amps. 

BTW, the AC will only be used when I'm on the boat which I plan to stay on semi-regularly because it's much closer to where I work and it's parked about an hour from my house making early morning sails difficult if I have to drive there before sunrise on the weekend. 

I could easily hook this up in a house or on dry land, but I don't have experience with a boat system. My main questions are:

1. What are some good references for electrical systems on boats?

2. How does grounding work on a boat?

3. What kind of switches/breakers should I use? Any good online shops?

4. Any good tutorials online? (I found one that's for a boat just like mine named OYSTERCATCHER, but he did more than I think I want). 

5. The batteries are coupled through a Off-1-Both-2 battery selector switch. If I hook up a dual battery charger are there any cautions I should heed concerning this switch prior to hooking up a charger? If the switch is in ""both"" and the charger comes on, will my boat catch fire, blow up, or kill me? I don't really want to die in a marina. That would be like a hurricane striking one week after I bought my first boat :(

Also, I don't want to break the bank. I don't have huge funding, so the simpler then better. Would it be better to have AC to battery charger and make everything 12V with converters off DC circuit where needed? I'd also like to hear from your experience with adding shorepower connections if you've done so.",1503766662.0,3,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/6w6n5n/120vac_shorepower_install_questions/

I would like to avoid a gasoline outboard and only need the motor because the mooring field is quite crowded, so the motor would be stowed once the boat was clear of it and not be running for very long.

Here is an **archived** post regarding electric motors for sailboats:
[torqeedo](https://redd.it/3162d2)  that covered a lot but I didn't get a chance to ask questions.

I'm currently thinking of an 80lb Minn Kota trolling motor with a pair of 12V 35AH batteries. At full power draw these batteries should last about 35 minutes but much more at around 1/2 hull speed.

Is 80lbs thrust overkill for a 400lb sailboat?  Although I only need the motor to go in/out of the mooring field, I wonder if dealing with ocean waves, currents and tides might require it.

If anyone has any experience with a 55lb trolling motor on the ocean, I'd really like to hear from you. Going to a 12V motor would be a lot easier, less costly, and make it possible get a 50AH or higher battery.

At least on one I got to examine, the Travel 1103's tiller's detent is pretty stiff compared to the resistance in the rest of the range of rotation. I wonder if the Spirit 1.0 Plus's is softer or stiffer.

OK, I am a welder  I really love doing that. I also really love boating, especially jet boats, and I wanna make my own and I’ve done countless hours of research trying to find good parts and engines for one and this is the list I made up.

            Jet boat build.                     

 •  Engine: Rotax 1630 ACE (230-300 hp for 100 mph).

•  Hull: 12-foot aluminum V-bottom hull with skid plate, reinforced bow/transom, and marine coating (e.g., Line-X).

•  Jet Pump: Sea-Doo 155 mm or 159 mm pump with stainless steel impeller (custom-pitched via Impellers.com or 4-Tec Performance) and heavy-duty intake grate.

•  Seats: Two high-back bucket seats with harness pass-throughs.

•  Seat Shocks: Four adjustable coil-over shocks per seat (e.g., Fox 2.0) or two if space-constrained.

•  Roll Cage: Lightweight chromoly/aluminum roll cage with solid roof, anchored to hull frame.

•  Fire Extinguisher: Marine-rated 2.5-5 lb ABC extinguisher with quick-release mount.

•  Flotation System: Auto-inflating airbags or foam-filled compartments.

•  6-Point Harness: SFI/FIA-rated 6-point harness with quick-release cam-lock buckle (e.g., Simpson, Schroth).

•  Steering/Controls: Marine-grade cable/hydraulic steering and foot throttle.

•  Bilge Pump: Automatic 2000 GPH bilge pump with manual override.

•  Fuel System: 10-15 gallon marine fuel tank with high-flow pump and venting.

•  Electrical System: Marine-grade AGM battery, waterproof wiring, and kill switch.

•  Navigation/Safety Lights: Red/green bow lights, white stern light, optional LED spotlights.

•  Personal Safety Gear: Auto-inflating life jackets, open-face helmets, EPIRB/PLB.

•  Gauges: RPM, GPS speed, fuel, temperature gauges, optional depth finder.

•  Cooling System: Closed-loop or open-loop cooling with debris strainer.

•  Hull Reinforcement: Skid plate (UHMW or stainless steel) and reinforced high-stress areas.

•  Ride Plate/Trim Tabs: Adjustable ride plate and trim tabs for stability.

•  Communication: Marine-grade intercom system (e.g., Sena) or Bluetooth speaker.

•  Storage: Waterproof compartments for gear and emergency supplies.

•  Anti-Slip Deck: Non-slip coating (e.g., KiwiGrip) on cockpit floor.

•  Backup Propulsion: Collapsible paddle or electric trolling motor (e.g., Minn Kota).

•  First Aid/Toolkit: Marine-grade first aid kit and compact toolkit in waterproof storage.

•  Protective Covers: Engine and cockpit covers (UV-resistant, waterproof).

•  Data Logger: Performance monitoring system for engine and jet pump.


        Additional add ons 
                   for safety

1#Ride Plate and Trim Tabs
	
•  Why: A ride plate and trim tabs improve handling and stability at high speeds, especially in choppy or rough waters. They help keep the boat level, reduce porpoising (bouncing), and enhance control during sharp turns at 100 mph.

	•  Recommendation: Install an adjustable ride plate compatible with the jet pump (e.g., Sea-Doo or aftermarket) to fine-tune planing and reduce drag. Add trim tabs (manual or hydraulic) to adjust the hull’s angle dynamically in rough conditions.
	
•  Benefit: Improves maneuverability, reduces driver fatigue, and enhances safety by maintaining control in turbulent waters.

2#Sound System or Communication Device
	
•  Why: In a noisy jet boat at 100 mph, communication between the driver and passenger (or other boats) is challenging, especially in rough terrain where quick coordination may be needed for safety.
	
•  Recommendation: Install a marine-grade intercom system (e.g., Sena or Rugged Radios) with noise-canceling headsets integrated into helmets. Alternatively, a waterproof Bluetooth speaker can provide audio cues or music for recreational use, but prioritize communication for safety.
	
•  Benefit: Enhances situational awareness, allows clear communication in emergencies, and improves the experience for recreational trips.


3#First Aid Kit and Emergency Toolkit
	
•  Why: High-speed operation in rough terrain carries risks of injury (e.g., from impacts) or mechanical issues (e.g., loose fittings). A first aid kit and basic tools are essential for addressing emergencies on the water.
	
•  Recommendation: Include a marine-grade first aid kit with trauma supplies (e.g., bandages, tourniquet, antiseptic) and a compact toolkit with essentials (e.g., wrenches, pliers, duct tape, zip ties). Store in a waterproof compartment.
	
•  Benefit: Enhances preparedness for medical or mechanical emergencies, especially in remote areas.

1kz5ee8,boating,"15 hour review, 2024 Yamaha 222 FSH Sport E","15 hour review, 2024 Yamaha 222 FSH Sport E We live on the Fla panhandle and bought this boat so we could go farther away from port and have the luxury of 2 motors in case 1 took a dump. We bought this because it was a 2024 and the 2025 looks identical minus the 10k more. Remember to have a pair of vice grips on board to cut off a water inlet hose in case you have to run on 1 motor. Evidently water can get forced into an engine that is off - that sounds awful. The electric throttle/gear shift is funky. It's as if we have to fish around to find neutral to get the motors started. I do miss the positive feeling you get when shifting with true cables. The bench seat is far enough away from the controls to be an annoyance. I see where the 255 is better positioned but this is something I simply deal with.

Odd fact, the boat favors the port side. I think this is because of the 3 batteries and the fuel tank. I compensate by filling the livewell on the starboard side. This helps immensely. Compared to other boats this size, it is not a heavy boat. This has pros and cons of its' own. Regarding the livewell, people aren't too cool with the internal shape of it, but it seems fine for me. It can hold a mess of baitfish and the pump works great.

I have had boats for 50 years. I have had waverunners as well, so I have dealt with the jet propulsion. The first trip out was a trial as you have no trim/tilt as you would on an outboard. Motor speed and bow position become more critical than *ever* to navigate the chop and you do get better at it. The gunwales on the boat are absolutely awesome. They are very tall and you will get a dry ride. The hull is a pure V and when piloted right I see other boats in the inlet at St. Andrews with the same attitude as mine. This is where a heavier boat would be a bit better.

The trailer pulls fine, the tongue swings away which is a nice touch. We did relocate the spare tire as it was in a silly position. I spray all the leaf springs, brake hardware (minus pads and rotors) with CRC 6-56 to prevent corrosion. I also spray the engine compartment and the rear jet assemblies and linkage as well with this.

The Simrad works great. The nav system it has is top notch. I use echo mostly on the fishfinder for better views. The radio/stereo is meh. It could have been better but I am not blasting AC/DC on 4 speakers pulling skiers either. I could truly see the ski boats wanting more. We did add a VHF which is a super idea as you get emergency weather reports when you least expect them. The engines...ah the engines...are a thing of beauty. We have the new 1.9s non-supercharged. I run 93 non ethanol even though it's not necessary. They are awesome. They respond like an EV - instantaneous. The sweet spot for mileage is 30-ish. I can do 50 fully loaded with passengers. People have said they are noisy - yes they are. I could add more sound deadener inside but idc right now.

For fishing, you can fish all over this boat. We added the adhesive backed mats on the rear deck (this should be standard equipment from Yamaha) and we can sit back there and just enjoy everything. Rod holders and cup holders are everywhere. Rod storage is everywhere. I can troll with no issue. I can easily keep it at 5-6mph and maintain a true track. Would Cobra Jet Steering fins help me? Absolutely. I may get some, but for the time being I can do what I need to do.

As far as quality goes, I have pulled several zip ties out of the drain hole. The boat is black and Yamaha (the dealer states) ran a high speed wheel on it and made swirl marks that you can see when the sun hits it right. The dealer is going to get their fiberglass guy to get rid of those next week on their dime. Dealer says this happens often, so beware.

We really enjoy the boat. It is striking to see and you see a bunch of them on the water. I could not swing a Grady White or Mako with twin 200s on the back otherwise sure, I would have gotten that. For the price point of having a 22' boat with 2 engines there was really no better choice for the money. The sprawling Yamaha rear deck is also something not equaled and the wifey really likes that when we hit the local sandbars and beaches. It's a lot of fun and I trust the Yamaha name with their motors. They have yet to let me down.",1748614720.0,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/boating/comments/1kz5ee8/15_hour_review_2024_yamaha_222_fsh_sport_e/
1gc5zlg,boating,using an e-foil motor as an outboard to propel a boat,"using an e-foil motor as an outboard to propel a boat hi guys, possibly a somewhat weird question here. I am looking to use an e-foil motor to push my 21' pontoon boat which I've already built out as a solar-electric conversion job. problem is the pair of electric motors I am using to push it are more or less trash -- poorly-pitched propellers that I can't find replacements for, only 2200W each, and they weren't designed for steering wheel use to begin with and building the hardware to make that work has been an immense PITA rife with failures. so I'm looking to move to something that's just one motor -- less drag, more power, more reliable, etc.

part of the way I have made steering wheel steering work is by adapting the shell of a gas motor to take the steering cable/control rod and move the shell back and forth, which I feel like I could also use with an e-foil motor if I can get it securely attached to something I can then securely attach to the shell.

I have been looking at kits like this: [https://maytech.cn/products/efoil-surfboard-kit-65162-waterproof-motor-300a-85v-vesc-mtskr1905wf-remote](https://maytech.cn/products/efoil-surfboard-kit-65162-waterproof-motor-300a-85v-vesc-mtskr1905wf-remote) problem is that I don't know (and the vendors never seem to know either) how the motor is attached to... well, anything at all. ideally, I would find an e-foil mast that fits this motor, put the mast up through the middle of the shell, bolt it into place and call it a day. all of the motors I have been able to find in this class are like this -- cylinders with what look like set-screws going into them, wires coming out the front, a prop shaft on the back, and not really anything else. this makes me think there is some ""obvious"" way to mount it on an e-foil mast that I just haven't seen yet.

could I buy an Elco or an e-Propulsion? sure, but they are 5X the cost for less power and no clear gain other than ""we milled some aluminum/steel to make your steering work."" hoping other people in this sub who have done DIY projects like this have some advice for how to proceed.

For a very slow boat, would the deeper end of that range be better? the shallower end? neither?

(This is for a floating-dock boat, which has a channel of free-flowing water in the middle, like a (regular) pontoon boat, but which moves very slowly, probably 3 - 4 mph (4 - 6 kph).)

I'd guess that, at low boat speeds, there's more pressure reduction in front of the prop, so you'd need more depth to avoid ventilation. Is that correct or backwards (or insignificant)?

Looking for something safe and stable for our 6-year-old, easy to handle, and simple to store.

We’re thinking an inflatable we can carry or roll to our association beach and launch easily. Not comfortable working a trailer at this point, but maybe in the future. Mainly looking at Sea Eagle runabout models and would love opinions on it or other options we should consider. 

We’d like to pair it with an electric motor to avoid the complexity of a gas motor (maybe ePropulsion or Torqeedo?).

1mkk5kn,boating,Hi I need some advice,"Hi I need some advice I am new to Reddit so I’m sorry if I’m doing something dumb 

OK, I am a welder  I really love doing that. I also really love boating, especially jet boats, and I wanna make my own and I’ve done countless hours of research trying to find good parts and engines for one and this is the list I made up.

            Jet boat build.                     

 •  Engine: Rotax 1630 ACE (230-300 hp for 100 mph).

•  Hull: 12-foot aluminum V-bottom hull with skid plate, reinforced bow/transom, and marine coating (e.g., Line-X).

•  Jet Pump: Sea-Doo 155 mm or 159 mm pump with stainless steel impeller (custom-pitched via Impellers.com or 4-Tec Performance) and heavy-duty intake grate.

•  Seats: Two high-back bucket seats with harness pass-throughs.

•  Seat Shocks: Four adjustable coil-over shocks per seat (e.g., Fox 2.0) or two if space-constrained.

•  Roll Cage: Lightweight chromoly/aluminum roll cage with solid roof, anchored to hull frame.

•  Fire Extinguisher: Marine-rated 2.5-5 lb ABC extinguisher with quick-release mount.

•  Flotation System: Auto-inflating airbags or foam-filled compartments.

•  6-Point Harness: SFI/FIA-rated 6-point harness with quick-release cam-lock buckle (e.g., Simpson, Schroth).

•  Steering/Controls: Marine-grade cable/hydraulic steering and foot throttle.

•  Bilge Pump: Automatic 2000 GPH bilge pump with manual override.

•  Fuel System: 10-15 gallon marine fuel tank with high-flow pump and venting.

•  Electrical System: Marine-grade AGM battery, waterproof wiring, and kill switch.

•  Navigation/Safety Lights: Red/green bow lights, white stern light, optional LED spotlights.

•  Personal Safety Gear: Auto-inflating life jackets, open-face helmets, EPIRB/PLB.

•  Gauges: RPM, GPS speed, fuel, temperature gauges, optional depth finder.

•  Cooling System: Closed-loop or open-loop cooling with debris strainer.

•  Hull Reinforcement: Skid plate (UHMW or stainless steel) and reinforced high-stress areas.

•  Ride Plate/Trim Tabs: Adjustable ride plate and trim tabs for stability.

•  Communication: Marine-grade intercom system (e.g., Sena) or Bluetooth speaker.

•  Storage: Waterproof compartments for gear and emergency supplies.

•  Anti-Slip Deck: Non-slip coating (e.g., KiwiGrip) on cockpit floor.

•  Backup Propulsion: Collapsible paddle or electric trolling motor (e.g., Minn Kota).

•  First Aid/Toolkit: Marine-grade first aid kit and compact toolkit in waterproof storage.

•  Protective Covers: Engine and cockpit covers (UV-resistant, waterproof).

•  Data Logger: Performance monitoring system for engine and jet pump.


        Additional add ons 
                   for safety

1#Ride Plate and Trim Tabs
	
•  Why: A ride plate and trim tabs improve handling and stability at high speeds, especially in choppy or rough waters. They help keep the boat level, reduce porpoising (bouncing), and enhance control during sharp turns at 100 mph.

	•  Recommendation: Install an adjustable ride plate compatible with the jet pump (e.g., Sea-Doo or aftermarket) to fine-tune planing and reduce drag. Add trim tabs (manual or hydraulic) to adjust the hull’s angle dynamically in rough conditions.
	
•  Benefit: Improves maneuverability, reduces driver fatigue, and enhances safety by maintaining control in turbulent waters.

2#Sound System or Communication Device
	
•  Why: In a noisy jet boat at 100 mph, communication between the driver and passenger (or other boats) is challenging, especially in rough terrain where quick coordination may be needed for safety.
	
•  Recommendation: Install a marine-grade intercom system (e.g., Sena or Rugged Radios) with noise-canceling headsets integrated into helmets. Alternatively, a waterproof Bluetooth speaker can provide audio cues or music for recreational use, but prioritize communication for safety.
	
•  Benefit: Enhances situational awareness, allows clear communication in emergencies, and improves the experience for recreational trips.


3#First Aid Kit and Emergency Toolkit
	
•  Why: High-speed operation in rough terrain carries risks of injury (e.g., from impacts) or mechanical issues (e.g., loose fittings). A first aid kit and basic tools are essential for addressing emergencies on the water.
	
•  Recommendation: Include a marine-grade first aid kit with trauma supplies (e.g., bandages, tourniquet, antiseptic) and a compact toolkit with essentials (e.g., wrenches, pliers, duct tape, zip ties). Store in a waterproof compartment.
	
•  Benefit: Enhances preparedness for medical or mechanical emergencies, especially in remote areas.

1kz5ee8,boating,"15 hour review, 2024 Yamaha 222 FSH Sport E","15 hour review, 2024 Yamaha 222 FSH Sport E We live on the Fla panhandle and bought this boat so we could go farther away from port and have the luxury of 2 motors in case 1 took a dump. We bought this because it was a 2024 and the 2025 looks identical minus the 10k more. Remember to have a pair of vice grips on board to cut off a water inlet hose in case you have to run on 1 motor. Evidently water can get forced into an engine that is off - that sounds awful. The electric throttle/gear shift is funky. It's as if we have to fish around to find neutral to get the motors started. I do miss the positive feeling you get when shifting with true cables. The bench seat is far enough away from the controls to be an annoyance. I see where the 255 is better positioned but this is something I simply deal with.

Odd fact, the boat favors the port side. I think this is because of the 3 batteries and the fuel tank. I compensate by filling the livewell on the starboard side. This helps immensely. Compared to other boats this size, it is not a heavy boat. This has pros and cons of its' own. Regarding the livewell, people aren't too cool with the internal shape of it, but it seems fine for me. It can hold a mess of baitfish and the pump works great.

I have had boats for 50 years. I have had waverunners as well, so I have dealt with the jet propulsion. The first trip out was a trial as you have no trim/tilt as you would on an outboard. Motor speed and bow position become more critical than *ever* to navigate the chop and you do get better at it. The gunwales on the boat are absolutely awesome. They are very tall and you will get a dry ride. The hull is a pure V and when piloted right I see other boats in the inlet at St. Andrews with the same attitude as mine. This is where a heavier boat would be a bit better.

The trailer pulls fine, the tongue swings away which is a nice touch. We did relocate the spare tire as it was in a silly position. I spray all the leaf springs, brake hardware (minus pads and rotors) with CRC 6-56 to prevent corrosion. I also spray the engine compartment and the rear jet assemblies and linkage as well with this.

The Simrad works great. The nav system it has is top notch. I use echo mostly on the fishfinder for better views. The radio/stereo is meh. It could have been better but I am not blasting AC/DC on 4 speakers pulling skiers either. I could truly see the ski boats wanting more. We did add a VHF which is a super idea as you get emergency weather reports when you least expect them. The engines...ah the engines...are a thing of beauty. We have the new 1.9s non-supercharged. I run 93 non ethanol even though it's not necessary. They are awesome. They respond like an EV - instantaneous. The sweet spot for mileage is 30-ish. I can do 50 fully loaded with passengers. People have said they are noisy - yes they are. I could add more sound deadener inside but idc right now.

For fishing, you can fish all over this boat. We added the adhesive backed mats on the rear deck (this should be standard equipment from Yamaha) and we can sit back there and just enjoy everything. Rod holders and cup holders are everywhere. Rod storage is everywhere. I can troll with no issue. I can easily keep it at 5-6mph and maintain a true track. Would Cobra Jet Steering fins help me? Absolutely. I may get some, but for the time being I can do what I need to do.

As far as quality goes, I have pulled several zip ties out of the drain hole. The boat is black and Yamaha (the dealer states) ran a high speed wheel on it and made swirl marks that you can see when the sun hits it right. The dealer is going to get their fiberglass guy to get rid of those next week on their dime. Dealer says this happens often, so beware.

We really enjoy the boat. It is striking to see and you see a bunch of them on the water. I could not swing a Grady White or Mako with twin 200s on the back otherwise sure, I would have gotten that. For the price point of having a 22' boat with 2 engines there was really no better choice for the money. The sprawling Yamaha rear deck is also something not equaled and the wifey really likes that when we hit the local sandbars and beaches. It's a lot of fun and I trust the Yamaha name with their motors. They have yet to let me down.",1748614720.0,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/boating/comments/1kz5ee8/15_hour_review_2024_yamaha_222_fsh_sport_e/
1gc5zlg,boating,using an e-foil motor as an outboard to propel a boat,"using an e-foil motor as an outboard to propel a boat hi guys, possibly a somewhat weird question here. I am looking to use an e-foil motor to push my 21' pontoon boat which I've already built out as a solar-electric conversion job. problem is the pair of electric motors I am using to push it are more or less trash -- poorly-pitched propellers that I can't find replacements for, only 2200W each, and they weren't designed for steering wheel use to begin with and building the hardware to make that work has been an immense PITA rife with failures. so I'm looking to move to something that's just one motor -- less drag, more power, more reliable, etc.

part of the way I have made steering wheel steering work is by adapting the shell of a gas motor to take the steering cable/control rod and move the shell back and forth, which I feel like I could also use with an e-foil motor if I can get it securely attached to something I can then securely attach to the shell.

I have been looking at kits like this: [https://maytech.cn/products/efoil-surfboard-kit-65162-waterproof-motor-300a-85v-vesc-mtskr1905wf-remote](https://maytech.cn/products/efoil-surfboard-kit-65162-waterproof-motor-300a-85v-vesc-mtskr1905wf-remote) problem is that I don't know (and the vendors never seem to know either) how the motor is attached to... well, anything at all. ideally, I would find an e-foil mast that fits this motor, put the mast up through the middle of the shell, bolt it into place and call it a day. all of the motors I have been able to find in this class are like this -- cylinders with what look like set-screws going into them, wires coming out the front, a prop shaft on the back, and not really anything else. this makes me think there is some ""obvious"" way to mount it on an e-foil mast that I just haven't seen yet.

could I buy an Elco or an e-Propulsion? sure, but they are 5X the cost for less power and no clear gain other than ""we milled some aluminum/steel to make your steering work."" hoping other people in this sub who have done DIY projects like this have some advice for how to proceed.

1d30f6i,boating,Thoughts on electric outboards?,"Thoughts on electric outboards? Recently I've found myself intrigued by the idea of electric outboards. I've been reading up about them and they seem to have quite a few advantages. I'm looking for reviews from actual owners of electric outboards to get a better perspective.

Performance is key, and I’ve got a few concerns about how electric outboards stack up against traditional gas engines. How do they handle in terms of speed and power, especially for longer trips or in rougher conditions? And what about range?

Initial costs for electric outboards seem higher, but I’ve read that maintenance can be simpler and cheaper. For those who've switched, how has this played out for you financially? Are savings on gas and maintenance a worth the switch? How long do you estimate your battery to last before a change?

I’m also curious about the practical side of things. If I wanted to retrofit my current boat with an electric outboard, how complicated is that process? Are there certain types of boats that are better suited for electric outboards? Any tips or things to watch out for would be super helpful. 

The outboards themselves seem to be a lot quieter in some of the videos I've seen. Would love to know if it makes for a better experience on the water.

Improvements in battery technology and the push for greener options seem promising. What advancements are you most looking forward to? Do you think electric outboards will become the norm?

Would love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and any advice you might have. If you've got any great articles, videos, or resources on electric outboards, please share!

I have precious little time to go out on the water as it is! So I’ve been trying to do research on the lowest maintenance outboards. So far I’ve been looking at either lightweight low hp outboards like the small Tohatsu models or the electric ones like Newport/epropulsion, and am open to any suggestion you might have! There is a lot of info out there and it seems every other page and video is sponsored in one way or another — posting in hopes that I can hear from people who have a small outboard that doesn’t require tons of maintenance and gets them where they’re going. Dunno if it matters, but I use my boat to get to good swimming/hangout spots/casual exploration, not fishing. 


TLDR: 
The most important things to me are being low maintenance/reliable, not getting stuck out there after an hour, and just fast enough to not feel like I’m stuck in the mud. Lightweight is a huge plus.

17o4bjh,boating,How much force to turn handle out of neutral on ePropulsion Spirit 1.0 Plus vs. Torqeedo Travel 1103 C?,"How much force to turn handle out of neutral on ePropulsion Spirit 1.0 Plus vs. Torqeedo Travel 1103 C? Does anyone here know whether it's easier or harder to turn the tiller handle (throttle control) out of the detent for neutral on the ePropulsion Spirit 1.0 Plus than on the Torqeedo Travel 1103 C? (Or, better but less likely yet, know what those torque amounts are?) 

Why? I'm wondering how hard it would be to rig up remote throttle control on a Spirit 1.0 Plus (whose tiller control isn't removable and ""remotable"" via an extension cable as on the somewhat pricier Travel 1103 (or Spirit 1.0 Evo)) by using a rotary servo or linear actuator to rotate the tiller handle. (No, this isn't for serious or regular use, just for occasional and temporary playing around on a small, very slow boat.)

At least on one I got to examine, the Travel 1103's tiller's detent is pretty stiff compared to the resistance in the rest of the range of rotation. I wonder if the Spirit 1.0 Plus's is softer or stiffer. Someone [mentions](https://www.pbo.co.uk/gear/epropulsion-electric-outboard-on-test-how-it-performs-long-term-76278#:~:text=there's,resistance%20throttle) that the Plus's resistance is adjustable, but it's not clear how much.

1czuniy,boating,My jack stand caused my trailer tongue to warp. How can I fix this?,"My jack stand caused my trailer tongue to warp. How can I fix this? Photos can be found here:

[https://photos.app.goo.gl/4XWtwe2RizYcky9X6](https://photos.app.goo.gl/4XWtwe2RizYcky9X6)

One of the beams on my A-Frame trailer tongue was twisted by my trailer jack. Now, even when I am not resting the trailer tongue on the jack, the beam is still bent (granted, not as bent as when the weight is resting on the trailer jack).

I'm assuming that it isn't safe to tow the trailer now that the tongue is bent, right? And more importantly, is there a good way to fix this? I can move the trailer jack closer to the coupler to reduce the twisting stress in the future, but that won't fix the damage that has already been done. I don't think that I would be able to order the broken part a-la-carte; I would need to buy an entire new kit which would take a couple of months to arrive, and even then, I might have the same problem.

My current idea is to weld on some type of metal bar to reinforce the beam. I could probably clamp the straight new stronger beam to the twisted old weaker beam while welding it to effectively knock the twist out of the beam. There are a couple of issues though. First, I was thinking to weld the reinforcement inside the beam and I'm not sure how I would strip the paint from the inside of the beam. It's open, but the opening isn't big enough to fit my angle grinder's strip disks. Second, I'm not sure what dimension of bar to use. The outer dimensions of the existing beam are 1 ⅝ in x 2 ⅜ in. I was thinking of using either a  2"" x 1"" rectangular tube (potentially with a steel bar to fill in the extra gap), a 2""x1"" rectangular channel, or a couple of angle 1""x1"" angle irons.

Does this sound like it will work?  Any other suggestions?

Additional information :

I assembled my own trailer from Harbor Freight and installed a rolling trailer jack stand (also from Harbor Freight) which as far as I can tell was designed especially for this trailer. Here are links to the two products:

[https://www.harborfreight.com/automotive/trailers-towing/trailers/1720-lb-capacity-48-in-x-96-in-super-duty-folding-trailer-62671.html](https://www.harborfreight.com/automotive/trailers-towing/trailers/1720-lb-capacity-48-in-x-96-in-super-duty-folding-trailer-62671.html)

I am shocked and concerned because the A frame twisted so easily. I wouldn't think that there is enough weight on the tongue to justify this twisting. I am pretty sure that the weight of the entire trailer is between 1500 lbs and 1700 lbs. While this is pretty close to the max trailer weight, I think that the tongue weight is actually a bit low. With these numbers, the tongue weight should be 10-15% which would be 150 lbs to 255 lbs. I don't think that it is that high because I can still lift the tongue on my own. Is this frame just total shit? Did I install the jack incorrectly? The other beam of the A frame is perfectly untwisted.

In case you were wondering, the trailer is being used to store and transport 11 kayaks and gear. Although they are technically boats, I understand that it might not be completely in the spirit of this subreddit. I figured that this community would know the most about dealing with trailers since there isn't a designated subreddit for trailers.

Performance is key, and I’ve got a few concerns about how electric outboards stack up against traditional gas engines. How do they handle in terms of speed and power, especially for longer trips or in rougher conditions? And what about range?

Initial costs for electric outboards seem higher, but I’ve read that maintenance can be simpler and cheaper. For those who've switched, how has this played out for you financially? Are savings on gas and maintenance a worth the switch? How long do you estimate your battery to last before a change?

I’m also curious about the practical side of things. If I wanted to retrofit my current boat with an electric outboard, how complicated is that process? Are there certain types of boats that are better suited for electric outboards? Any tips or things to watch out for would be super helpful. 

The outboards themselves seem to be a lot quieter in some of the videos I've seen. Would love to know if it makes for a better experience on the water.

Improvements in battery technology and the push for greener options seem promising. What advancements are you most looking forward to? Do you think electric outboards will become the norm?

Just wanted to share everything I’ve done to my boat this year—might help or inspire anyone planning their own maintenance marathon.

I’m going into my 5th year with a 2009 inboard 5.0 MerCruiser MPI. It’s been great for my needs. I kept it moored in freshwater for the first few years, and it’s been dry stored the last two.

This year, I decided to give her the full treatment. Here’s the list:
	•	Sandblasted and repainted the sterndrive
	•	Replaced the gimbal bearing, all bellows (exhaust, drive, shift), and the shift cable
	•	Changed all trim cylinder hoses
	•	Replaced the raw water pump, serpentine belt, spark plugs, air filter, and water separator
	•	Replaced the senders sensors

Also (finally!) got rid of my old Northstar unit and upgraded to a Raymarine Axiom 9 with the V100. Installed it with a NavPod mount—clean and functional setup.

For the exhaust bellows, I rigged up a zip-tie handle to pull it in place, applied the adhesive, and zip-tied it around the sterndrive in the down position for 24 hours to let it cure properly.

It might sound easy writing it all out like this, but I’ve honestly spent most of the winter, countless nights, weekends, and nearly all of June working on her. It’s been a labor of love, and now she’s finally ready for the season. I’m stoked with how everything turned out.

If anyone’s working on similar projects or has questions, happy to share what worked for me.

I've boated most my life on the west coast and I know nothing about dories, which from my understanding are a favourite of the East coast fisherman due to their offshore handling.  It's outfitted with two pairs of oarlocks but I'm imagining a 20HP Yamaha long shaft on that transom.

Here's is my list of question, chat: What do you know about Dories that I should take into consideration? What HP is most suitable for this boat? What cruising speed should I aim for? What are it's limitations in the water? What Dory features should I look forward to and take advantage of? What amenities have you seen on dories that I should add?

It is a 17ft, super heavy duty, self bailing, custom welded aluminum centre console with an 8ft beam. Electronics consist of mercury blue tooth digital gauges and GPS/depth sounder, fish finder. Marine radio with all the bells and whistles. Current power is 150HP with a 10hp tiller kicker. Current fuel capacity is 50Gallons, shared tank for both engines.

Thank you in advance. 

Things I’m currently planning on doing. 
Cutting up the floor (filling with more floatation foam) also reinforcing some under floor beams that are cracking
Building/installing a secondary tank under the floor, unsure regarding size, due to weight and range needs due to new engine plans.
Repowering with a new Yamaha 115, to lose 100lbs. 150is wild overkill for this size boat. Even loaded up. 
Building a metal with glass welded t-top for more light weight storage and better wind and weather protection, including better lighting, although night driving boats in the PNW is a fools errand, aka emergencies only.
I would buy the AIS transponder thing. 
Wouldn’t buy a life raft but debating two blow up paddle boards to go on the t-top. 
Debating having a outboard pod made, which would free up the deep outboard engine well for more space in the boat, and stretch the boat out another 2-3 feet for better performance. But negatives I would need a new kicker as the tiller wouldn’t reach, and would have to pair up the kicker to the engine for steering which relies on one system, for all engine steering. I like the separation of the kicker.

Mercury introduces Joystick Steering
for Single-Engine Vessels

MIAMI (Feb. 14, 2024) — Mercury Marine®, a division of Brunswick
Corporation (NYSE: BC), today introduced Mercury Joystick Steering for Single-Engine Vessels, compatible for use with the Mercury Verado® family of V8, V10 and V12 outboard engines from 250 to 600hp, at the Discover Boating™ Miami International Boat Show in Miami Beach, Florida. 

Enhanced by electric steering, Joystick Steering for Single-Engine Vessels rounds out Mercury’s suite of joystick systems, delivering effortless command and
control to owners of vessels powered by sterndrives, inboards, Zeus® pod drives, multi-outboard installations, multi-outboards with an integrated bow thruster, single-engine pontoons with deployable thrusters, and now, boats with only a single outboard engine for propulsion.

“This new joystick steering system is unique in that it is specifically designed for single-engine vessels. It features a simple, single-touchpoint user interface for throttle, shift and steering, facilitating ergonomic one-handed operation,” said Tyler Mehrl, senior category manager, joystick, steering, and throttle & shift controls.

Joystick Steering for Single-Engine Vessels eliminates the need for boaters to use both hands to throttle, shift and steer during low-speed maneuvers like docking. Not only is one-handed operation more convenient, but the precision control that the steering system provides will give users greater confidence in situations where maneuvering a single outboard can be more challenging than a multi-engine configuration.

The new single-engine joystick has a sleek design without any physical buttons. It allows for proportional forward and reverse movement and the twist function provides precise, intuitive steering.

When Joystick Steering for Single-Engine Vessels is integrated with a
compatible multifunction display (MFD) incorporating GPS and Mercury SmartCraft Connect, it also offers autopilot features. “There are two autopilot features, Heading and Route,” Mehrl explained. “You easily can setup a route on the MFD by dropping waypoints. 
When the Heading function is activated, you can make 1- or 10-degree adjustments to your heading on the MFD, or 10-degree adjustments by twisting the joystick, so you can use it to really fine-tune your direction of travel.”

Want well maintained late model or maybe even new to spend most of the time on the water and not fixing things. Also desire a high build quality for the same reason, and nice amenities for the wife. Models like the Fairline Squadron 42 (if we could find a later one), Tiara C39, Riviera 39, Sabre 43 or 45 Salon Express have caught our eye. Sportfishers not in the consideration set.   


Here‘s the conundrum: pretty vocal blowback from people on every boating/yachting website on PODs, Volvo IPS, etc, yet that’s pretty much all these renowned boating brands even offer on their more recent models. If you want these boat brands, you have no other drivetrain choice.   


As someone who runs a decent sized business myself, I would think the people running these boat companies would be smart enough not to put their brands at risk by putting all their eggs in one basket, unless they were highly confident that the drivetrain quality was on par with the rest of the boat. And I would hope that Volvo and the other POD manufacturers have continually improved the product so as to not go broke from warranty claims and drive away future customers, and that as the installed base of product has continued to proliferate, that the number and quality of service techs has likewise improved. Would love to hear from anyone with real world experience either running or servicing newer product. TIA!",1691868630.0,2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/boating/comments/15pdase/volvo_ips_conundrum/
157qlc6,boating,Why can engines with similar power output have vastly different sizes? (Volvo Penta IPS vs. Mercury V12),"Why can engines with similar power output have vastly different sizes? (Volvo Penta IPS vs. Mercury V12) So Im relatively new to boating/yachting and theres one question I couldnt really find an answer to.

Why are there vastly different sized engines, that can have similar power output?

I stumbled across for example the Pardo 38 yacht which can be equipped with a Volvo Penta IPS engine with Pod drive or outbord motors. 

The Volvo Penta IPS 800 for example makes 650 hp while the Mercury V12 makes 600 hp. But the Volvo one is like....10x the size/volume? 

Whats up with that? What are the advantages of an inboard/outbord motor and why are they vastly different in size? Why would you ever choose a massive inboard (pods or shaft drive) compared to an outboard, when the inboard takes up 10x the volume? 

Ive also seen boats (forgot the brand sadly) that had just outboard engines equipped where usually inboard engines would go and the engine room was basically empty because of that? 

Im so confused. Any helpful explanation very much appreciated!

With all the selection out there, I'm hoping to get some suggestions on what to go with.

Currently have (4) Polk Audio DB651 60W RMS 4ohm 6.5"" speakers.  These are being driven by a Clarion Marine APX480M amplifier, 4 x 80W RMS.

I've got other amplifiers, WetSounds subs and pods, and some ""tube"" speaker units that are double-ended facing fore and aft, but most of that equipment directs the sounds to aft and I'd like to have a better listening experience in the cockpit.  That's where the 4 inward-facing arch speakers come in.

Should I go up to 80W RMS for the 4 replacements since the amplifier can drive that?  What brand would you recommend?  Any advice?

qms7zg,boating,Advice for a boat in the Pacific Northwest,"Advice for a boat in the Pacific Northwest I have a 26’ water sports boat that I use in Lake Washington and I’m looking to buy a bigger (52-60’) boat for cruising in Puget Sound, including during Spring and Fall and maybe even Winter. We’re a family of 5 (3 kids) and would also like to bring friends along on occasion. I like several boats, they each have their pros and cons for us personally, but  I go back and forth about drive types and whether I want a fly bridge or not.

Drive options: I’m looking at boats with both shaft drives and IPS pod drives. Some have told me that shaft drives are better for the Pacific Northwest because of the logs and other obstacles in the water because they will do more damage to an IPS drive than a shaft drive. I understand that damage to a shaft and prop will be less expensive than a pod drive and I realize I should avoid hitting things in the first place, but stuff happens and I’ve never sailed in Puget Sound before. Are logs and other obstacles really that common? Are they easier to avoid than I’m lead to believe?

Fly bridge or no fly bridge: I like the look of a boat without a fly bridge better but the fly bridge has its appeal (outside, more seating space, better view). I realize during summer it’d be great and it’d be nice to be up high in marinas, but assuming I wouldn’t be spending a lot of time in marinas, is a fly bridge useful/desirable in the Pacific Northwest?

1i0zqvm,boating,Horsepower equivalent for electric outboard motors?,"Horsepower equivalent for electric outboard motors? I own a 46 lb Newport trolling motor and was looking to upgrade to a proper electric outboard with around 3 horsepower for my dinghy. Most electric outboard motors have a rating in watts as well as a ""horsepower equivalent"". However, these figures often do not match. For instance, the Newport NT300 is an electric outboard motor that is rated at 1300 watts peak power but is also a ""3 horsepower"" motor. However, there are only 750 watts in one horsepower, so shouldn't this be a 1.7 horsepower motor instead? The torqueedo electric outboard is much the same - it's rated for 3 horsepower equivalent but only has 1100 watts. Can someone explain this discrepancy? Are transmission losses in small gas outboards so bad that you lose more than a third of your power in the gearbox? Do the different characteristics of electric motors mean that power represents different things? Or does ""horsepower equivalent"" mean something else?

1d30f6i,boating,Thoughts on electric outboards?,"Thoughts on electric outboards? Recently I've found myself intrigued by the idea of electric outboards. I've been reading up about them and they seem to have quite a few advantages. I'm looking for reviews from actual owners of electric outboards to get a better perspective.

Performance is key, and I’ve got a few concerns about how electric outboards stack up against traditional gas engines. How do they handle in terms of speed and power, especially for longer trips or in rougher conditions? And what about range?

Initial costs for electric outboards seem higher, but I’ve read that maintenance can be simpler and cheaper. For those who've switched, how has this played out for you financially? Are savings on gas and maintenance a worth the switch? How long do you estimate your battery to last before a change?

I’m also curious about the practical side of things. If I wanted to retrofit my current boat with an electric outboard, how complicated is that process? Are there certain types of boats that are better suited for electric outboards? Any tips or things to watch out for would be super helpful. 

The outboards themselves seem to be a lot quieter in some of the videos I've seen. Would love to know if it makes for a better experience on the water.

Improvements in battery technology and the push for greener options seem promising. What advancements are you most looking forward to? Do you think electric outboards will become the norm?

Would love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and any advice you might have. If you've got any great articles, videos, or resources on electric outboards, please share!

and charging LiFePO4 batteries off lots of solar. The solar charging is a major part of this dream because I would like generally to avoid relying on marinas for that.

I would consider a trailer sailer as long as it has a retractable keel or centerboard so I can beach it, and room for all the solar panels, the required number and size of which I have not yet determined. 

But I would rather avoid the upkeep a sailboat requires, and for me the actual activity of sailing is fun sometimes and sometimes onerous. And also the aforementioned standing-height pref is hard to come by in a small sailboat. Still, using the wind would be a nice option to have.

For a very slow boat, would the deeper end of that range be better? the shallower end? neither?

(This is for a floating-dock boat, which has a channel of free-flowing water in the middle, like a (regular) pontoon boat, but which moves very slowly, probably 3 - 4 mph (4 - 6 kph).)

I'd guess that, at low boat speeds, there's more pressure reduction in front of the prop, so you'd need more depth to avoid ventilation. Is that correct or backwards (or insignificant)?

- when deciding on shaft length, does the prop need to be lower than the actual pontoons? Or do I just need it to be below the water line?

- how crazy is this plan? We're on a small lake and don't need to go above putzing speed. My only real concern is wind... Do you think this thing will be able to get the giant pontoon back to the dock in moderately windy conditions?

I did experiment with a trolling motor last season and it mostly worked well. I think this thing should be about 3x as powerful which I think should work.

c56mq3,boating,electric outboard question,"electric outboard question hi everyone,

has anyone installed or has experience with an electric outboard as a  secondary engine (kicker, auxiliary engine). I want one in case of emergency in case my main motor breaks. my boat is an 18 ft (5.4 meters) Ranieri Soverato (i found an image on google, this is not my boat, but looks exactly like it https://img1.annuncicdn.it/73/be/73be1b53562484a848cecd2147e1c9b1_orig.jpg)

The boat w/o engine is 540 kg. The engine is 186kg. so a dry weight of 726kg (or 1600 lbs).

I found a few electric outboards in the 66lbs to 70lbs that are still in a 12v configuration that claim to support boats up to 2000 kg in weight. i have two marine batteries on my boat (with 1/2/1+2/off switch) with 60ah that i could use to drive the electric motor in case of emergency. i usually stay close to shore (<10 miles away), but if i were to take a long trip, i would take a portable generator with me (one of those 22kg ones) and a AC battery charger to be safe.

I don't want to get a gas outboard due to the maintenance issues and because i want to use the electric for some trolling+fishing.

Anyone has experience or thoughts to add to help in my decision. if electric won't work, obviously i would have to consider a 5-6hp gas engine.

be aware i usually only get out in good weather and i define an emergency when my main motor breaks. A super rare scenario would be my main motor breaks and i get caught in a storm. i understand the electric is at a disadvantage compared to a gas kicker here, but i am not sure a 6hp gas will be that much better in a big storm.",1561459605.0,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/boating/comments/c56mq3/electric_outboard_question/

1ny6lmu,boating,"Johnson Outboard - Was Cranking, Now Completely Dead. No Power to Engine or Electronics. Stumped.","Johnson Outboard - Was Cranking, Now Completely Dead. No Power to Engine or Electronics. Stumped. Hey everyone,

I’m hoping to get some help troubleshooting my Johnson outboard. I’m completely stumped and could use a fresh set of eyes.

The Boat: 1977 flag master  

The Problem:

	1.	Initially, the motor was turning over but wouldn’t start.
	2.	I primed the fuel bulb. After that, I suddenly have zero power.
	3.	When I turn the key now, absolutely nothing happens. No click, no sound, nothing.
	4.	I confirmed it’s not just the engine—my Lowrance Mark-4 fishfinder, which is wired to the same battery, is also dead. This seems to indicate a total electrical failure.

What I’ve Done So Far:

	•	Fuel: Drained old fuel and put in fresh gas.
	•	Battery: The battery was weak, so I’m using jumper cables from a known-good source. I’ve double-checked the connections are clean and tight.
	•	Fuses: I found and replaced the main fuse on the engine itself.
	•	Neutral Safety: Confirmed the shifter is firmly in Neutral.
	•	Kill Switch: The kill switch lanyard is in place.
	•	Master Switch: I’ve searched everywhere for a master battery cut-off switch but haven’t found one.

The core issue seems to be that no power is getting from the battery to anything on the boat. Since both the engine and the separate fishfinder are dead, I don’t think it’s the starter solenoid or ignition switch anymore.

I’ve attached photos of the engine, the battery compartment/jumper setup, and the wiring I can see.

Does anyone have any ideas what could cause a total power loss like this? Is there a hidden main breaker or fuse I might be missing on a Johnson of this era?

Thanks in advance for any advice!",1759614588.0,5,41,https://v.redd.it/fzw466vu06tf1
1nd0l40,boating,Just Because it’s Old Doesn’t Mean It’s Trash,"Just Because it’s Old Doesn’t Mean It’s Trash I see a lot of people ask about old cheap boats and whether they’re worth saving or not. Having just saved an old boat, I figured I’d share some thoughts and how it’s gone for me so far.

1st thing to verify is what is the boat made of? I’d highly recommend verifying whatever you purchase if it’s sat for a while is all glass or mostly glass. Having knowledge of the brand is a huge plus. This Neptune 201 I bought is all glass except the transom which is reinforced with wood. This doesn’t have to be a deal breaker, but make sure you know how to verify if the boat is solid or not.

2nd thing is do your best to verify the gas tank is clean and to have a good understanding of the motors history if applicable. I had multiple opportunities to buy beaters but wouldn’t do so due to a lack of maintenance. This boat sat for 2 years but the owners had a long history of engine maintenance. 2 strokes can be dreams or nightmares and a lot of that stems from maintenance done over time. Anything that’s sat will require work, but repairs are cheaper than rebuilds or replacements. I had all 6 carbs rebuilt, the impeller replaced, and the oil in the lower unit replaced. I spent about 1100 all in but it was well worth having no worries out on the water. I also ditched the oil pump in favor of premixing at the pump. If you’re buying a beater and it doesn’t have a motor or the motors for sure blown…I’d say don’t buy it. You don’t want to exceed the boats value and a new 4 stroke on a 30 year old starter boat is not usually the best option.

3rd thing is most of these 80s and 90s boats have cheap thru-hole fittings and hoses. Your best bet is to either replace them or use 5200 glue to seal them up. In my case all of the fittings are in pretty good shape so I just scraped the glue around all of them and resealed them all from the exterior and interior. I verified all of the hoses weren’t dry rotted. I then made sure the drains and baitwell pump had seacocks installed that still worked. This saved me as the baitwell pump was leaking badly on the first sea trial from a crack in the pump I missed.

4th thing and arguably most important for after you’ve gotten past everything above, the electrical and to break that down further, the bulge pump(s). If it’s older than a few years, do yourself a favor and go ahead and replace it. And don’t go cheap. It may be the only thing to save you. If you’re serious about buying an old boat, wiring and electrical knowledge is a must. The wiring in a 30 year old boat is going to be badly eroded and most likely not useable. I had to install all new wiring from the batteries to the helms, a new fuse block and all new switches for everything. New horn, you name it, I replaced it or abandoned it. This is the only sure fire way to guarantee your day on the water has the best possible chance of success.

So all these things considered, what did I spend? Well, I likely went a little overboard but since the mechanic finished the engine work, we’ve used the boat 3-4 times with the whole family and not had any major issues which was precisely what I was going for. I replaced the compass, switches, all of the motor and electrical work listed above, Bimini top, new radio and additional speakers (a weekend must), new rod holders, a new seat, and a new fish finder with gps. The cushions are all in decent shape which saved some cash for sure. With boat purchase price I’m in it roughly $5700 with the value of the boat between $7000 to $10000 (estimate comes from sold prices on Facebook and other marketplaces for this model boat in decent shape). As long as I can manage a few seasons with minimal repairs, I feel I made out well for a fiberglass boat with an outboard. Most boats in the 5000-10000 range are Jon boats or inboards which increase your risk for disaster tremendously.

So to sum everything up, don’t buy an old boat unless you are well versed in how to repair them, know a mechanic, and/or just have endless money to blow.

I was exploring small fishing boats, and saw plastic fishing boats, and wondered how they held up compared to traditional fishing boats?

I am 20 years old and I want to go on a solo sailing trip. I have a small Jeanneau Sun Fast 20 in Germany. My rough idea is to start somewhere in Italy (maybe Genove) and then make my Way along the coast to Portugal and then maybe even all the way up to Rotterdam where i would head onto the rhine, bringing me right back home to Germany. My thinking was to ease myself into the open sea, by starting in the mediterranean, since it would be my first time in open waters with my boat. What is a good time in the year for that regarding weather? Please let me know yout thoughts and im also happy to hear any similar Stories on the matter.

While im getting Lots of Feedback and ideas (thanks for that) might aswell add the question for a suitable outboard Motor.

1dsy9g9,boating,What is the future of boating?,"What is the future of boating? I’m curious to hear what the opinions are on the future of boating.  Fuel continues to get more and more expensive - in my area of the world fuel is $2/liter. Even running my relatively fuel efficient 90HP Yamaha costs a fair bit for a day on the water. Electric outboards exist, and will likely continue to improve, but it’s doubtful IMO that we’ll see the kind of breakthrough with electric boats that we’ve seen with electric cars. Boat hulls can last a long time and traditionally it’s just a matter of a re-power to keep it going but going electric means a lot of changes and many boats simply can’t be modified for the battery storage.  Many marinas would also have to upgrade their power infrastructure to provide power for recharging on the scale necessary (not impossible but expensive).  Plus due to the drag from water as compared to air, boating will always be a very energy intensive means of transportation, and there never has been the efficiency of scale of manufacturing in boats as there are in cars to get economies of scale and lower prices. 
So - will boating become a much more exclusive activity for those who can continue to pay the fuel costs (and are fine with their associated large carbon output). Or will electrification make a bigger break through? Either way, longer term it seems the boat market could really soften in the long run (5-10 years)",1719853675.0,22,84,https://www.reddit.com/r/boating/comments/1dsy9g9/what_is_the_future_of_boating/

ive done some research on whats suited for me, im interested in getting the inflatable boat Saturn SD415 13’.8” airdeck floor with a Hangkai 18hp outboard!! it carries 6-7 people so i can fit all my friends in there. 

i can break in the motor in the backyard and store the inflatable in the basement. when ready to boat, ill roll out the vessel onto a trolley to the car. the car sometimes is parked 2-3 blocks away (street parking, i dont have a garage). and ill walk back and get the motor. 

the con about this boat is that, i have to put 1/2 the second row seats down in my Nissan Rogue, so itll take out 1-2 passengers. so that means i can only bring 3-4 people on my boat in a single trip. my friends dont own cars here in NYC, unless i can find another friend that has another car, that would fit the rest of the people. to fit total of 6-7 people for 2 cars if were doing a whole friends boating day. 

the main things im getting: 
1. Saturn SD415 in light grey color 
2. Hangkai 18hp outboard motor
3. electric pump 
4. white bimini canopy top 
5. non-drilling dolley wheels

extras: 
- foldable trolley cart 
- portable collapsible toilet 
- lifejackets 

overall spend average would be $3k-$3.5k. there are some boat launch ramps that are free within the 5 boroughs!! so excited about this.

I understand that with twin outboards the real benefits start creeping in as you can start moving laterally to help with docking and so forth. With a single outboard you would be limited to just forward and back. Obviously can still turn the joystick with single outboard (i.e. turn the bow a certain direction).

Fishpoint does sound good though (keeps position for fishing). Staypoint (keeps position and heading) wouldn't be available as only works on twin outboards.

Auto navigation sounds good too.

Sounds like its something I want, but would love to hear from someone who actually has this setup on single outboard and what they think.

1kson4x,boating,First Time Boat Purchase for Eastern NC,"First Time Boat Purchase for Eastern NC Hey everyone, I need some opinions!

  
So, my wife and I are still looking around to get our first boat. We both have a decent amount of experience with boating and the water in general. My wife has a good amount of experience piloting boats from when her family had one, and is always our charter captain when we do our yearly vacation in the Caribbean (typically a 42-46 foot cat). For my own part I have experience with a lot of DC/AC electrical and do a lot of work on our gas ATV engine and the diesel tractor we own. I am not an engine head (engines do not excite me), but I can perform some level of troubleshooting, repair, tune-up, and observe conditions that indicate the engine is in significant danger of damage if further operated further or a professional are not called very quickly. 

With that primer my wife and I are ready to buy a boat, but I want some external opinions. Our primary purpose in owning a boat is to toodle around in it, not just sit in a marina, not jet out to fish somewhere, but to sort of put-put around the area (ICW/Neuse/Pamlico) with the ability to overnight. Basically we will be spending a lot of time underway. 

 My wife is more interested in the express cruiser/cruiser market. She likes the ample outdoor seating and decent seating area inside.  My concerns with this are that I do not want an inboard gasoline engine for safety reasons. I also do not like how difficult most of the compartments are for inboard diesel either. I also find that the costs associated with finding a slip are expensive. They also seem to consume staggering amounts of fuel under way and will break the bank with fuel, storage, and maintenance. Basically, I feel like they are so cheap on the market for used boats because they are not only money pits, but they are also money dungeons, where money has no hope of ever seeing the sun again. 

I have sort of fallen in love with Dory hulls. Their fuel effiency and nautrical look seem like something we could work with well, I also like the outboard motor and towability. We've been looking at C-Dorys and Rosboroughs (>age of 2004) and I find them to be very cool. My wife is not against it, it does excite her less, but she is quite reasonable and does understand the cons of the express cruisers. My cousin who owns a Grady-White, and has been boating in the area for 50 years thinks these boats are ""Rollie-Pollies"", which probably can be true if you take them into situations they don't belong. 

So, if anyone has any opinions please let me know, this is a hard choice to make!",1747914425.0,0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/boating/comments/1kson4x/first_time_boat_purchase_for_eastern_nc/

I recently inherited a boat with a Nissan NSF18B 4-stroke outboard and I’m still getting used to it. One thing I’ve noticed is that if it sits for a few hours, it doesn’t like to start right away. With the electric start, I usually have to crank it a few times before it finally fires. Is that expected for these motors? Do you normally have to squeeze the primer bulb every time, even if it’s only been sitting a couple hours?

my old carb’d dirt bikes and ATVs, they’d usually fire up in a kick or two.  With this outboard, pull starting after it’s been sitting seems almost impossible — it just won’t go after a few pulls. Using the electric starter and letting it crank a bit seems to be the only way to get it running.

So the story is a couple years ago the electronics stopped on the way back into the boat ramp. Tilt and trim stopped and from memory it also wouldn't start. 
The boat sat for a little while until I had time to build my shed and actually started working on it to try and fix whatever was going on.
Eventually a mate who has some knowledge on wiring and such and I get to pulling stuff apart as I was refurbishing the flooring and such and adjusting a few things with the boat layout. Found an extra extension cable coiled up under the flooring, connecting from the cable on the console, and then to the motor. We removed this extra length as it was excessive and connected the console directly with the motor and wouldn't you know the motor started fine, tilt/trim worked fine. Amazing.  Ran the motor for a short period ( <1min) and it worked well.
Boat goes back away until I can finish the flooring, accessories wiring to secondary battery etc. 

About 12 months later that's all finished, go to run the motor with muffs on to give it a run and flush it out. Starts fine, but bonding wires start smoking.
Have a look over connections, everything appears good. 
Boat then sat for another 12 months because I couldn't figure it out. 
Attemp to look at it again yesterday and find its blowing fuses etc and still smoking the wired. It only happens when youa re trying to run the motor. 
When the battery is attached and ignition off, it's fine, no issues.
The motor is the only thing connected to the battery too.

Bucket of knowns vs Bucket of unknowns I have about 25 years of boating experience, most of which has been on some version of a ""bargain"" boat that of course turned into anything but. From my 1995 Supra Sunsport that needed all the stringers replaced to the 1999 Proline 201WA that suffered from a life in a saltwater slip, I've been bit a number of times but keep coming back. In 2023, I purchased a 1993 Westcoaster Widebody which had been repowered in 2019 with a nice new Yamaha 50 (with 60 hours when I bought it) and modern electronics. It's kind of opened my eyes to how much better an experience it is when you have an unquestionably reliable boat.  
  
Fast forward to today and our other boat is a 1982 Bayliner Explorer 2070 that I share with my father. As of two weeks ago, we finally got our slip in the Santa Cruz Harbor. The boat was cheap but of course we've since sunk another $6,000 into it replacing the fuel tank and tuning up the outdrive and engine. (AQ125/270 combo). The hull is in really great shape as it spent most of it's life in a covered shop or a covered slip before I bought it and stored it in a carport, until now. It definitely needs work including tracking down an electrical gremlin and replacing the broken swim platform with a kicker bracket so we can have some backup power. We'll be doing those two things, but it begs the question: do we cut our losses? Will this boat ever be as reliable as something else could be?  
  
We love the layout of this boat as it has sleeping for 4 below deck and room for 5 under the hardtop, as well as a decent space for fishing. My dad mostly uses this boat to hang out at the harbor...he actually doesn't even drive the boat. I use it mostly for fishing, though I take my family (wife, 5 year old, and 6 year old) out for cruises as well. We also know that, for now, the hull is in good shape with no signs of rot (\*knock on wood\*) even when we had the deck cut open to replace the fuel tank. However, we know that keeping the old Volvo running reliably will be an uphill battle, especially now that it's stored in the water.  
  
A boat to replace ours would likely cost between $15,000-$25,000 if we wanted it to tick all (most) of the boxes: well maintained outboard with reasonable hours, hardtop, usable cuddy cabin, and a setup for fishing. Most of these would still be a bit of a gamble in terms of ""what issues are in hiding"" and from what I've seen, none of them will have the space in the cockpit. I can't imagine getting more than $5,000-7,000 for ours, and even that is a bit optimistic.

-Trailer: Included. Good condition. New tires. 
-Condition: Minor interior wear and tear, but overall good for the age
-Mechanical: Motor seems to run well
-Electrical: Everything appears to function with no known issues
-Hull: No damage or cracks

1kz5ee8,boating,"15 hour review, 2024 Yamaha 222 FSH Sport E","15 hour review, 2024 Yamaha 222 FSH Sport E We live on the Fla panhandle and bought this boat so we could go farther away from port and have the luxury of 2 motors in case 1 took a dump. We bought this because it was a 2024 and the 2025 looks identical minus the 10k more. Remember to have a pair of vice grips on board to cut off a water inlet hose in case you have to run on 1 motor. Evidently water can get forced into an engine that is off - that sounds awful. The electric throttle/gear shift is funky. It's as if we have to fish around to find neutral to get the motors started. I do miss the positive feeling you get when shifting with true cables. The bench seat is far enough away from the controls to be an annoyance. I see where the 255 is better positioned but this is something I simply deal with.

Odd fact, the boat favors the port side. I think this is because of the 3 batteries and the fuel tank. I compensate by filling the livewell on the starboard side. This helps immensely. Compared to other boats this size, it is not a heavy boat. This has pros and cons of its' own. Regarding the livewell, people aren't too cool with the internal shape of it, but it seems fine for me. It can hold a mess of baitfish and the pump works great.

I have had boats for 50 years. I have had waverunners as well, so I have dealt with the jet propulsion. The first trip out was a trial as you have no trim/tilt as you would on an outboard. Motor speed and bow position become more critical than *ever* to navigate the chop and you do get better at it. The gunwales on the boat are absolutely awesome. They are very tall and you will get a dry ride. The hull is a pure V and when piloted right I see other boats in the inlet at St. Andrews with the same attitude as mine. This is where a heavier boat would be a bit better.

The trailer pulls fine, the tongue swings away which is a nice touch. We did relocate the spare tire as it was in a silly position. I spray all the leaf springs, brake hardware (minus pads and rotors) with CRC 6-56 to prevent corrosion. I also spray the engine compartment and the rear jet assemblies and linkage as well with this.

The Simrad works great. The nav system it has is top notch. I use echo mostly on the fishfinder for better views. The radio/stereo is meh. It could have been better but I am not blasting AC/DC on 4 speakers pulling skiers either. I could truly see the ski boats wanting more. We did add a VHF which is a super idea as you get emergency weather reports when you least expect them. The engines...ah the engines...are a thing of beauty. We have the new 1.9s non-supercharged. I run 93 non ethanol even though it's not necessary. They are awesome. They respond like an EV - instantaneous. The sweet spot for mileage is 30-ish. I can do 50 fully loaded with passengers. People have said they are noisy - yes they are. I could add more sound deadener inside but idc right now.

For fishing, you can fish all over this boat. We added the adhesive backed mats on the rear deck (this should be standard equipment from Yamaha) and we can sit back there and just enjoy everything. Rod holders and cup holders are everywhere. Rod storage is everywhere. I can troll with no issue. I can easily keep it at 5-6mph and maintain a true track. Would Cobra Jet Steering fins help me? Absolutely. I may get some, but for the time being I can do what I need to do.

As far as quality goes, I have pulled several zip ties out of the drain hole. The boat is black and Yamaha (the dealer states) ran a high speed wheel on it and made swirl marks that you can see when the sun hits it right. The dealer is going to get their fiberglass guy to get rid of those next week on their dime. Dealer says this happens often, so beware.

We really enjoy the boat. It is striking to see and you see a bunch of them on the water. I could not swing a Grady White or Mako with twin 200s on the back otherwise sure, I would have gotten that. For the price point of having a 22' boat with 2 engines there was really no better choice for the money. The sprawling Yamaha rear deck is also something not equaled and the wifey really likes that when we hit the local sandbars and beaches. It's a lot of fun and I trust the Yamaha name with their motors. They have yet to let me down.",1748614720.0,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/boating/comments/1kz5ee8/15_hour_review_2024_yamaha_222_fsh_sport_e/

The trim/tilt only works if I press **both** the switch at the helm and the one on the engine at the same time. Neither works on its own — no sound, no movement. Just dead. 

  
I found that when pressing both switches at the same time, I can start up the engine but once I release one of the switches, the engine cuts out.. as does the trim.

I just put in a brand-new starting battery (MCA 1000 RC130) and dual-purpose battery (MCA 675 RC130). Accessories (radio, lights, etc.) all work fine. Just no consistent power to the engine.

Thinking it could be:

* Bad ground somewhere? I changed out the ground wire so far
* Trim relay or fuse issue? I swapped out 2 fuses on the outboard, although they looked fine
* Corroded or loose connection?

Any ideas on what to check or how to troubleshoot this? I’ll gladly post pics or run multimeter tests if needed. Just trying to figure it out and get her dropped in the water asap!

1ighhpq,boating,Impact of tariffs on electric boating.,"Impact of tariffs on electric boating. I'm trying to keep this post as non-political as possible. I own a couple of SIBs (both Intexes) along with a Newport trolling motor. I purchased a 12V, 100ah (1.2 kwh) LFP battery on Amazon (UL-certified, of course) for $200. With the end of the de minimus exemption and the additional tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, batteries and motors will cost significantly more. The first round of tariffs may not be the last, and it isn't unreasonable to expect significantly higher long-term tariffs on Chinese goods in the future (it's anyone's guess how long the Mexico and Canada tariffs will last). Like it or not, most of the products used for electric boating originate overseas, but the impact of tariffs is significantly higher on electric boating than gas-powered boating due to the lithium-ion batteries and electric motors involved. After all, you're paying much more for your equipment (battery + motor) than with a gas outboard, and gasoline prices won't be affected as much by these tariffs.

I'm not looking to start a heated political discussion - I want to keep this as neutral as possible. What do you think the tariffs will do to electric boating in America? Will it reduce the popularity of electric boating relative to gas (especially after battery prices came tumbling down in the last 2 years as cheap LFPs flooded the market)? Will consumers continue paying the higher prices? Will more people buy equipment second-hand? Will battery and motor prices continue dropping, counteracting the impact of the tariffs?",1738558937.0,2,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/boating/comments/1ighhpq/impact_of_tariffs_on_electric_boating/

In classic sailor fashion, he's left behind a driveway strewn with old boats, half of which have never seen the water. 

As a legacy project I've chosen to keep one: A 16' long, solid fiberglass (pretty heavy, approx 400-500lbs) Dory skiff. My hope is to fix it up and drop in the water to live out it's life as a spot prawn/salmon/Dungeness crab slayer. It's what the old man had always wanted.

I've boated most my life on the west coast and I know nothing about dories, which from my understanding are a favourite of the East coast fisherman due to their offshore handling.  It's outfitted with two pairs of oarlocks but I'm imagining a 20HP Yamaha long shaft on that transom.

Here's is my list of question, chat: What do you know about Dories that I should take into consideration? What HP is most suitable for this boat? What cruising speed should I aim for? What are it's limitations in the water? What Dory features should I look forward to and take advantage of? What amenities have you seen on dories that I should add?

1gc5zlg,boating,using an e-foil motor as an outboard to propel a boat,"using an e-foil motor as an outboard to propel a boat hi guys, possibly a somewhat weird question here. I am looking to use an e-foil motor to push my 21' pontoon boat which I've already built out as a solar-electric conversion job. problem is the pair of electric motors I am using to push it are more or less trash -- poorly-pitched propellers that I can't find replacements for, only 2200W each, and they weren't designed for steering wheel use to begin with and building the hardware to make that work has been an immense PITA rife with failures. so I'm looking to move to something that's just one motor -- less drag, more power, more reliable, etc.

part of the way I have made steering wheel steering work is by adapting the shell of a gas motor to take the steering cable/control rod and move the shell back and forth, which I feel like I could also use with an e-foil motor if I can get it securely attached to something I can then securely attach to the shell.

I have been looking at kits like this: [https://maytech.cn/products/efoil-surfboard-kit-65162-waterproof-motor-300a-85v-vesc-mtskr1905wf-remote](https://maytech.cn/products/efoil-surfboard-kit-65162-waterproof-motor-300a-85v-vesc-mtskr1905wf-remote) problem is that I don't know (and the vendors never seem to know either) how the motor is attached to... well, anything at all. ideally, I would find an e-foil mast that fits this motor, put the mast up through the middle of the shell, bolt it into place and call it a day. all of the motors I have been able to find in this class are like this -- cylinders with what look like set-screws going into them, wires coming out the front, a prop shaft on the back, and not really anything else. this makes me think there is some ""obvious"" way to mount it on an e-foil mast that I just haven't seen yet.

could I buy an Elco or an e-Propulsion? sure, but they are 5X the cost for less power and no clear gain other than ""we milled some aluminum/steel to make your steering work."" hoping other people in this sub who have done DIY projects like this have some advice for how to proceed.

1h8vsvu,boating,Outboard Motor Repair or Replace?,"Outboard Motor Repair or Replace? I have a 2001 Crest pontoon, 22 feet that I completely remodeled last year. All new decking, flooring, console, furniture, electrical, etc. I did not replace the motor, which is a 2000 Mercury 2 stroke, 3 cylinder, 90 hp. This year, it started to develop a clunking sound and had a some reduced power at wide open throttle. We took it to a mechanic who did some preliminary diagnostics and he thinks the bearing between the connecting rod and crankshaft on the 3rd cylinder is shot. It seems like we've got 3 options:

1.	Try to repair the motor. Mechanic said it is very likely that the crankshaft is damaged and we'd need to replace it along with the connecting rod. He also said it can be very hard to find replacement parts for these engines and they tend to be expensive. This seems like a risky option considering we don't know exactly how much damage there is or if we can even get the parts we need. 

2.	Repower with a used motor. This gives us the ability to upgrade to a 4 stroke, which would be great. There is effectively zero market for used outboards around me (Kansas City area). I have the technical ability to install everything myself and could save money this way. This seems like it could be risky because I'd probably have to buy a motor remotely and ship it without being able see how it runs. 

3.	Repower with a new motor. It seems like manufacturers will not warranty their motors unless they are installed by their authorized dealers, so I wouldn't install it myself to keep the warranty. This is the most expensive option by far.  

A replacement does not need to be a 90 hp motor. We could go down in power but not up as 90 is the max the boat is rated for. Transom is all aluminum and is in great condition. 
What are the other options I’m missing? What would you do if you were in my shoes? Thanks for your help.",1733588049.0,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/boating/comments/1h8vsvu/outboard_motor_repair_or_replace/
1f6j9xp,boating,Jet ski maintenance unreasonable? ,"Jet ski maintenance unreasonable?  Father in law has a 24’ pontoon with a 90hp outboard and a 2013 SeaDoo 155(?). 

Brother-in-law puts the pontoon in the water yesterday, swap the old battery with another one he finds in the garage, runs the motor a bit. Says it’s a little rough and he’s going to run it at high rpm’s around the lake a bit to see if it smooths out. It’s the 4th time the motor has run this summer. Comes back, still rough. I’m thinking it needs a fogging, maybe new plugs. My FIL couldn’t remember when the last time it was worked on properly. BIL says it’s ok to load the family for a cruise though, so all 10 of us go, boat is off balance and sputtering the whole time. My daughter looked worried, so I just smiled and said what will happen will happen, just enjoy the ride. Kids at least had life vest on.

Jet ski has sat for 2 years. I suggested pulling it out of storage, putting new gas in, fog it, and running it on the lake at least forgot today. So we get it out. I install a good battery, check all hoses and connections, look for leaks/fluid in the bilge, add a gallon of premium no ethanol, connect a hose, and start it up in the drive for about 90 seconds. Puff of smoke, rough idle, but it runs. I check the trailer and notice the bow roller is missing. There are scratches on the hull and a hole forming through the gel coat. I check west marine online. They have rollers, brackets, gas treatment and fogging spray in store. 

I suggest what needs doing, at least on the jet ski and trailer. My MIL thinks about and say ok. Today I ask my BIL for help launching the jet ski. He wants to know my plan, then checks the jet ski after I have to show him where the problem is. He tries to lift the ski to move it farther back on the trailer, but doesn’t realize that it won’t slide on bunks. He goes the house and says it all needs too much work that he doesn’t have time for today. I suggest that I can. He looks at me and recommends to his mom that they just tow the jet ski to a shop and have them do everything because he doesn’t have time. 🤦‍♂️

Was what I suggested for the jet ski unreasonable? I don’t own a jet ski, but…
….  
… at home I’m regasketing the risers on my water cooled 1987 gm 5.7L omc conbra. I repacked 3 of 4 bearing on my random axle trailer as well as replaced the electric drum brakes. Next is installing a new proportional brake controller on the 2011 Grand Cherokee Laredo hemi I just bought, has the class iv tow package. I have one picked out on etrailer .com. Last year I repositioned the winch and bow stop bracket as well as installed a new winch. I winterize my boat in my drive, going on 9 years now.

Electric heat might be easier to install but I don't think my motor can make enough electricity to keep any kind of heating going? A space heater or electric heated seats.

So I can only start it with the pull cord and it has almost no issues starting up after 1-2 pulls. It runs absolutely great and has been super reliable on my 14’ job boat. One possible factor that could be contributing to the electric start malfunctioning is that I did add extension cables to the starting battery cables, because I need to store the batteries at the front of my boat for weight distribution for transporting and so the bow is not sticking up in the air when I’m running the boat on the water.

1c9iuat,boating,Old 1970s Evinrude fuel diagnosis help,"Old 1970s Evinrude fuel diagnosis help Hey all. I'm new to boating and I've been working on this old 1975 Cobia Sportster 17ft as a project for a little under a year. I've been having trouble with the engine, when I bought it the thing barely started and when it did it would idle super rough. Last weekend I cleaned the carbs and was able to get her started and running with a little ether, but the carbs basically need a full rebuild for any degree of reliablility. I have brand new plugs as well; In my head if I can get the engine running with ether, I have spark; but I have soft fuel lines (post fuel pump) and the engine doesnt stay running some of the time, this means I'm having a fuel problem.



Anyways heres the meat and potatoes of my question: I found what looks to me like an electric fuel pump in the engine, but an old timer at my old storage spot told me that these old evinrudes shouldn't have an electric fuel pump, rather they run on the vaccuum pressure from the primer bulk. Low and behold, yesterday I pull out the ""fuel pump"" since I was testing every fuel line to ensure I had proper flow, and it sure looks like a fuel pump to me - with 4 wires cut off and I have no idea how to wire these things up or how to orientate this pump at all. Do I even need this part? Can I just rig up the hose from the fuel line and bulb straight to the carbs?

I wasn't able to get the engine started yesterday for more than a few seconds even with ether. As I said I need to rebuild the carbs anyways and they're currently soaking while I order rebuild kits, so this potentially could be the issue as well, but I'm pretty convinced i'm having fuel issues.

Any input is appreciated.



For anyone trying to help



Pic 2 - Outboard motor, not sure what year but I believe its from the 70s, the internal fuel tank on the boat doesn't appear to be functional (I couldn't siphon anything out and the fuel lines were plugged in). The motor is running gas from a 5 gallon tank with a brand new mixed gas, bulb and fuel lines.



Pic 3 - picture of part of the ""fuel pump"", when I found it, it had all 4 wires chopped off.



Pic 4 - dissassembled pump continued, all gaskets, seals, etc looked fine although I've never rebuilt one of these so what do I know.



Pic 5 - more angles



Pic 6 - location i found this part, it was screwed into the engine block right underneath the starter.



Hoping I can find some old head that remembers a thing or two about these engines so I can keep this old boat running.



Thanks for the help and advance apologies for my ignorance on the subject.

When I turn the key the 'siren' sound before the starter engages sounds all well. But when I continue to turn the key instead of the starter engaging all that can be heard is 1 or 2 electrical crackling sounds.

For extra information it suddenly stopped working today without the motor ever having electrical issues before. It was somewhat gradual. On my first turn the starter went but extremely slow about a tenth or so of its usual speed. Thinking the battery was dying I replaced it with a battery with full charge. On my second attempt it barely attempted to start, the starter popped up and very slowly turned 2 or 3 teeth before I shut it off.

Not knowing much about electrical failures what are the first failure points / places I should look at?

2. The motor is quite old and doesn't have the capabilities to charge a staring battery.

This is the base model, with no EFI, no electric start, etc. I only recently put it in the water and have trouble consistently starting. From cold, I can usually start it, but as soon as I close the choke to the middle position it will die. When this happens, I am unable to restart it.

Some questions and thoughts:

- It is hard to tell if the bulb is totally full. I typically pump a couple of times, but the bulb still does not seem full. I am wondering it it has anything to do with the new pressure valve on the fuel line, in combination with using on an older (clean, new gas) 6 gal fuel tank. I ask, because the motor actually came with a 4 gal (I think) tank. I think these new tanks have some sort of pressure system inside. But the tank is too small for my needs, so I put a connector on the hose and connected to my 6 gal tank.

- The only times I have been sucesfull were when I left the fully choke out and let it warm up for like 5 to 10 min.

- The manual actually refers to the choke as being open when the knob is closed. I think this is a typo.

(Or, better but less likely yet, know what those torque amounts are?) 

Why? I'm wondering how hard it would be to rig up remote throttle control on a Spirit 1.0 Plus (whose tiller control isn't removable and ""remotable"" via an extension cable as on the somewhat pricier Travel 1103 (or Spirit 1.0 Evo)) by using a rotary servo or linear actuator to rotate the tiller handle. (No, this isn't for serious or regular use, just for occasional and temporary playing around on a small, very slow boat.)

At least on one I got to examine, the Travel 1103's tiller's detent is pretty stiff compared to the resistance in the rest of the range of rotation. I wonder if the Spirit 1.0 Plus's is softer or stiffer. Someone [mentions](https://www.pbo.co.uk/gear/epropulsion-electric-outboard-on-test-how-it-performs-long-term-76278#:~:text=there's,resistance%20throttle) that the Plus's resistance is adjustable, but it's not clear how much.

158bbsi,boating,Mercury 60hp Bigfoot with intermittent starting issues,"Mercury 60hp Bigfoot with intermittent starting issues TL;DR Merc outboard has intermittent no start condition, starter spins (seems weak), bendix sometimes engages but sometimes doesn't, trim motor sounds like it isn't at full strength during these episodes.

My wife and I have a pontoon boat that we use several times a week, and until recently, it has run flawless for the 2.5 seasons we've owned it.  The motor is a 2004 Merc 60hp Bifgoot, 4stroke EFI with 420 hours.  For whatever it's worth, we've put 200 of those hours on it in the relatively short time we have owned it.

A couple of weeks ago, we went out for an hour or so and had no trouble until we got back to our lift.  I shut the boat down, and then immediately realized I wanted to move the boat backwards a bit more and tried to start it (no more than 20 seconds after shutting it off), but it wouldn't crank.

I didn't have time to troubleshoot it then, so I went back down to the boat to try to diagnose the issue a few days later, and to my surprise, it fired up right away, no problems.

The boat was fine on the next few outings, until Saturday, when it wouldn't start again.  I popped the cowling off and jiggled the shift and throttle linkages, thinking that maybe the engine wasn't thinking its in neutral, and then the boat fired up.

Yesterday, we are back to the no start condition, and no about of jiggling linkages would help.  This time around, I had friend try to start it while I was back by the engine with the cowling off, and what I saw  was that the starter bendix was spinning, but it hadn't popped up quite enough to engage the flywheel.  I put pressure on the bendix to get it to engage while my friend turned the key, but it still wouldn't turn over.

Next we tried to put a jump box on the battery in case it was getting weak, but that didn't help either.

It's worth noting than I noticed anytime I am having these starting issues, the noise the motor makes when trimming it up or down sounds different than it normally does - it sounds much weaker and more strained.

We ended up using the emergency pull-start rope that you can hand wind, and that worked surprisingly smoothly and saved our day on the water.  We shut down once to let people swim, tried the key again and it didn't work, so we pull-started it again without any drama.

For grins, when we pulled back into our lift. I shut the boat off and tried to start it with the key again, and to my surprise, it fired right up effortlessly twice in a row!

Before I start throwing parts at it, I thought I'd see if the collective wisdom of r/boating might have any advice?

Since the trim sounds strange (only when I'm also having starter issues, I was thinking it might be something electrical in nature, but it seems strange that the problem would come and go like this.  The battery cables were nice and tight at both ends, and there was no sign of any damage to the starter solenoid, the starter, or the wiring.  I haven't taken the solenoid off to test it with a meter yet, but I imagine that may be my next step.

Tested compression, every cylinder in the mid 130’s at least before we stopped checking. Really looks clean with the cowling off. That’s where we got excited.

Here’s what I’ve done so far:
-New battery and all primary electric lines to outboard and the fuse box for accessory power.
-new fuel lines
-drained fuel and oil, replaced with ethanol free and fresh oil
-lower unit oil change, all gaskets and plugs new
-new impeller
-remote controller (quicksilver 3000) had some issues, went through it and replaced the neutral safety and emergency shutoff. 
-replaced the hydraulic steering cylinder as it was leaking and pitted and just didn’t want to deal with it.
-repainted outboard cowling and chaps with new sticker kit (because shiny)
-new spark plugs
-cleaned carbs, they were in great shape.
-adjusted throttle cables and brought idle down to about 1500 rpm, sounds happier there.
-replaced all fuses
-replaced fuel float and pulled new copper pair and ground to the main controller.


I’m doing a ton more cosmetic stuff like replacing the bumper insert and fixing upholstery but that’s not priority as that can be done once in the water. (Obviously a good detail) Boats now running really well and is turn key from the driveway at least….

Mercury introduces Joystick Steering
for Single-Engine Vessels

MIAMI (Feb. 14, 2024) — Mercury Marine®, a division of Brunswick
Corporation (NYSE: BC), today introduced Mercury Joystick Steering for Single-Engine Vessels, compatible for use with the Mercury Verado® family of V8, V10 and V12 outboard engines from 250 to 600hp, at the Discover Boating™ Miami International Boat Show in Miami Beach, Florida. 

Enhanced by electric steering, Joystick Steering for Single-Engine Vessels rounds out Mercury’s suite of joystick systems, delivering effortless command and
control to owners of vessels powered by sterndrives, inboards, Zeus® pod drives, multi-outboard installations, multi-outboards with an integrated bow thruster, single-engine pontoons with deployable thrusters, and now, boats with only a single outboard engine for propulsion.

“This new joystick steering system is unique in that it is specifically designed for single-engine vessels. It features a simple, single-touchpoint user interface for throttle, shift and steering, facilitating ergonomic one-handed operation,” said Tyler Mehrl, senior category manager, joystick, steering, and throttle & shift controls.

Joystick Steering for Single-Engine Vessels eliminates the need for boaters to use both hands to throttle, shift and steer during low-speed maneuvers like docking. Not only is one-handed operation more convenient, but the precision control that the steering system provides will give users greater confidence in situations where maneuvering a single outboard can be more challenging than a multi-engine configuration.

The new single-engine joystick has a sleek design without any physical buttons. It allows for proportional forward and reverse movement and the twist function provides precise, intuitive steering.

When Joystick Steering for Single-Engine Vessels is integrated with a
compatible multifunction display (MFD) incorporating GPS and Mercury SmartCraft Connect, it also offers autopilot features. “There are two autopilot features, Heading and Route,” Mehrl explained. “You easily can setup a route on the MFD by dropping waypoints. 
When the Heading function is activated, you can make 1- or 10-degree adjustments to your heading on the MFD, or 10-degree adjustments by twisting the joystick, so you can use it to really fine-tune your direction of travel.”

Mercury Joystick Steering for Single-Engine Vessels will be available starting from April, 2024.",1707949281.0,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/boating/comments/1aqzkk4/mercury_marine_introduces_joystick_steering_for/
1783q2g,boating,Boating LPT: Learn about shear pins,"Boating LPT: Learn about shear pins Many boat engines, especially smaller outboards, have a device called a ""shear pin"" installed in the propeller drive shaft.  
These perform an important task much like a fuse in an electrical circuit; these devices will break in order to save the rest of the motor.  
Typically they are small pinswhich run through the propeller shaft which engage the actual propeller. When the propeller strikes an immovable object the pin breaks (""shears"") apart thus saving the rest of the motor.

It's advised to have a spare (or 2) on board, have the tools to replace them (generally a socket wrench or pliers) and know how to replace them.

More than once have I had to replace these when out boating. Having the ability to fix these while on the water has saved me from much issues.

Like I said, I’m new to the boating world. I have had family that owned boats. Mostly fishing boats. I have purchased a couple kayaks before, one as long as the boat I just purchased, and didn’t realize this new (to me) boat might actually need a title. 

The boat in question is an old 14’ sailboat. It cost me $300 and it needs some work. The guy had never learned to sail after all and wifey said there were too many boats. There is no outboard motor, but the guy who sold it to me (and very confidently said the boat didn’t require a title because it had no motor and was only 14’) threw in a little electric motor, I think technically for a fishing boat. This motor is not installed on the boat at all. What he said about the title made sense to me, I’m not from TX. The places I have lived previously stipulated that boats under 16’ in length, or boats that were non-motorized, didn’t have to be registered or titled as far as I knew.

So from some googling I think I need to get a bonded title? I just got the thing home, so I’m not yet sure how extensively this boat will need to be rebuilt and not sure the year model but I would guess early 80’s. Does anyone know where/how I would find out the cost for a bonded title on such a boat? Or is there a different process that applies to this situation? 

I’ve googled myself in circles so far but I haven’t found a clear process or way to calculate the cost. I intend to go about this the correct, legal way, I’m just confused on the process.

EDIT: upon further inspection and research this boat is actually less than 14’ whereas I thought it was 14’ on the dot. So, from what I am gathering, this boat does NOT need to be register… ?

w818xc,boating,HP Restriction - Help me find a boat,"HP Restriction - Help me find a boat I'm looking to upgrade my bass boat to something with a larger deck. Bigger the better. Problem is that the club that I fish at has a 25hp restriction. 

Couple notes then a couple questions:

* I am not in a rush to get to a fishing spot. We have some pretty good sized lakes, which take about 15 minutes or so to get from one end to another. But I have zero issue trolling or simply cruising like a barge to get to where I need to go.
* Looking at aluminum bass boats or similar. Specifically for now - 18 to 21ft [Xpress bass boats](https://xpressboats.com/bass/xclusive-pro-bass/). 
* Fishing with 2 people normally, but there are now kids in the picture, etc. 
* I understand with a 25hp motor, there is no way these boats will get up on plane. 

Would it be terrible to put a 25hp on a huge 21 footer? I'm thinking the worst that will happen will be some splashing if I try to go too fast. I spoke with someone at Xpress, who said it was doable, but not something they really knew about. (I can't do the sticker swap, club is hunting people breaking the rules). 

Wondering if anyone here has any thoughts on this topic. Would a 25hp on a 21 work, just not great? Should I be looking at any other boats to accomplish biggest deck/smallest engine combo?

As simple as the tittle; which outboard produces lowest sound? 

I found this great comparison,  which concluded that yamaha was best with both least sound and highest top speed (probably due to larger cylinder size / higher torque).
However, the test is from 2016 and I don't know how these manufacturers changed their models. 

For example 'through prop exhaust' is something I see advertised at tohatsu (and this mercury also), not at yamaha or suzuki. No idea when it was introduced...

I looked at the specifications based assuming it would be 7.5 horsepower since it's called the ""7.5e"". I was kinda surprised however that it only has 750 watts going to the electric motor. 

So converting that to horse power this motor only has about 1 mechanical horsepower. The battery also is a 1000 kWh battery which would mean that if the motor was at full throttle for 1 hour and 15 minutes that it would be empty. 

I'm more writing this out of disappointment as there are already trolling motors that already exist that will likely be far cheaper than this set up, I'm also writing this in hopes to hear your opinions on this as well.

Mercury is also set to release the avator 20 and 35 which is most likely only 2 kW and 3.5 kW of power. Would any of you purchase this? Please let me know if I have my math wrong because this seems too easy to call out and I'm starting to doubt if I'm even making sense.

njjsxp,boating,Outboard motor recommendations,"Outboard motor recommendations Hello, all! My parents have a pretty basic Alumacraft that they are gifting us that is in pretty good shape. We would like to get an outboard to put on the back, and I'm hoping to get some advice to that end. Our considerations are as follows:

* We aren't looking to do anything too crazy. We have a family of 3, and we just want something that will get us from point A to point B at more than a snail's pace at a reasonable speed. 

* We are mostly looking to use it for fishing and to go for rides around the lake. No plans to pull anyone behind or anything.

* The lakes in our area tend to be long but narrow. Most are probably 5-10 miles long and 0.5-1 mile wide. Don't know that this matters, but figured I might as well mention it. The waves and weather generally aren't too bad. 

* I'm moderately handy. I can do basic mechanical work and maintenance, but I'm looking for something reliable. That's our top criteria. 

* Looking to buy new. Thought about used, but that's quite a gamble from everything I've read.

* We can't break the bank. We've got a few thousand we could put towards an outboard, maybe a bit more if necessary, but we're trying not to go overboard as this is very much for utilitarian purposes. At the end of the day, we are looking for good value.

I think that pretty much covers it. Any recommendations on brand, size (10-15 hp?), features I may want (or may want to avoid), considerations I haven't mentioned, etc. would be very much appreciated. Also, is it best to go through a dealer, or are there more economical ways to order (e.g. it appears there are some online dealers like Power Equipment Direct and Online Outboards).

I purchased a 1975 14'5"" Hourston Glascraft as a project boat last October (used to rig boats, have a lot of experience with mechanical and electrical but less with fiberglass / woodworking, hence the project). The boat had a soft spot in the floor (which I'm fixing), but rest of floor seemed okay and stringers seemed okay as well. Transom was suspect.

As life often goes, I got too busy over the winter and didn't get started on this yet. The transom, upon testing by flexing an outboard on the back of it (video of this in the link), has some play. There is no cracking in the gelcoat around the top / back of the transom, but there is some cracking and discoloration in the inner skin of the transom below the splashwell (I've included photos of all of this in the link).

Given this boat has a curved transom, my ultimate repair may be to use Seacast (if stringers really seem good) due to the complexity of keeping the curve through an actual rebuild, but for this summer, looking at (I know, not advised) temporary options to stiffen it up some.

Any thoughts on how bad this looks / possible temp fixes? I was thinking of an aluminum plate made to go over and across the transom, but it's tough with the transom not being flat.

Im at a bit of a loss here because of my inexperience and searching online hasnt helped because pretty much most boats are unlike each other. Can I mount it to the side of the stern or replace the rudder entirely? I really have no idea what my options are that arent forking out loads of money to crane in an inboard on top of buying an inboard. I appreciate any and all help! Thank you!

Edit: Added photo because I didnt do it correctly when I posted.

Edit 2: Thanks everyone for informing me about 135 being way too much, I have learned a lot prior to getting my yacht but there was always several questions I couldnt get any straight answers about, the HP needed was one of those. Thank you again, this has been incredibly helpful!

m5fs7b,boating,I need some help with a trailer...,"I need some help with a trailer... We have a family boathouse that took a hit this winter... The rotten stringers broke under the weight, the top came down, and the boat took a shot in the well. The lift was the only thing that kept it all afloat, but we need to do some maintenance and repairs that are not practical with the boat in the water.

It's a Four Winns, 205 Sundowner - Somewhere in the 88-92 range (Specifics have been lost to the generations, and it's an hour away). The windshield got crunched, the top was in the closet that went under, and it's been about a decade since the outboard side of things was serviced.

Where I am struggling, is coming up with a (23 ft.?) trailer... We are in the electrical/battery side of the business, but all our connections are talking about building custom trailers. Because, well, that's what they do. :)

We don't want to be disrespectful, but we only need a trailer temporarily for boat/lift maintenance. 

I realize it all varies based on location, but we are not boat trailer experts, given the fact that the boat(s) have always been ""in the water""...

Assuming that all we need is to move it less than 100 ft. off the launch up into the parking lot to do what we need to do - Any advice on the min/max trailer that could do the job?",1615795532.0,1,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/boating/comments/m5fs7b/i_need_some_help_with_a_trailer/
s9qowt,boating,Question on hooking up batteries in parallel,"Question on hooking up batteries in parallel I have two batteries in my 17' center console as a 12V system. One starter battery lives at the back and one deep cycle battery lives under my center console. These batteries are independent and not hooked up parallel.

My starter battery powers the outboard motor, livewell pump, bilge pump, and everything on the dash *including* my Garmin 73sv fish finder. Up underneath the center console, I have a deep cycle battery that just powers my Motorguide Xi5 12V-55lb trolling motor. 

I noticed that I have to switch my battery charger back and forth every couple days to keep my batteries charged and healthy, so I've been thinking to about either 1) buying another small NOCO battery charger (currently have one G3500) and charge the two batteries separately, or 2) maybe trying hooking the batteries up parallel so that the alternator can also charge the trolling motor battery when I'm cruising.

Would this pose any problems with the batteries or electrical components like the fish finder?

Thanks in advance!

&#x200B;

Some more data if they're helpful:

\- I asked to connect the fish finder to the starter battery because I heard the trolling motor can interfere with fish finder readings, but maybe it doesn't interfere... advice here would be appreciated

\- Trolling motor battery is 101 Ah and 690 MCA

\- Starter battery is 625 cranking amps",1642815013.0,1,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/boating/comments/s9qowt/question_on_hooking_up_batteries_in_parallel/

I have USCG engineering licenses for chief engineer, a captains license, and experience with engines from 2hp outboards to 5000hp diesels.  I’m one of those people who can fix most anything, but mechanical and electrical is my niche.  

I’ve worked on everything from fancy sailing yachts owned by hedge fund folks, to giant tugboats, to wooden tall ships. 

My plan is to say that I’ll come meet you and see your boat for up to an hour for free. I won’t charge travel time within a range that covers the two nearest marinas to me.  After that, shop rate is $70/hour and I would bill for all the time I dedicate to your boat unless I screw something up and it needs to be redone.

I took some measurements at what seemed like a reasonable cruising speed (4.5kts was in the 750W range):

|Watts|Speed|Est Duration|Est Range|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|306W|3.4kts|1200 WH / 306 W = 4 Hours|4 H \* 3.4 nm / H = 13.6 nm (15.7m)|

I'm thinking that if I connect the ePropulsion 200W Solar charger to my 12V house battery (which has about 2400Wh recharging from a 100W solar panel), I should be able to keep the net draw on the ePropulsion battery down to about 100Wh when running the motor at 300W.  

If I ignore all of the charging inefficiencies, I should be able to motor for about 12 hours over 2 days like this while conserving some power for other stuff (assuming I get 8 hours of charging on the 1st day). See below for the model. 

Has anyone used the ePropulsion motor like this, and charged at the same time as they motored?  Are there any downsides?  Or does ePropulsion expect for the charger to be used only while stopped (or to charge a second battery)?

1ighe5d,electricboats,Impact of tariffs on electric boating.,"Impact of tariffs on electric boating. I'm trying to keep this post as non-political as possible. I own a couple of SIBs (both Intexes) along with a Newport trolling motor. I purchased a 12V, 100ah (1.2 kwh) LFP battery on Amazon (UL-certified, of course) for $200. With the end of the de minimus exemption and the additional tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, batteries and motors will cost significantly more. The first round of tariffs may not be the last, and it isn't unreasonable to expect significantly higher long-term tariffs on Chinese goods in the future (it's anyone's guess how long the Mexico and Canada tariffs will last). Like it or not, most of the products used for electric boating originate overseas, but the impact of tariffs is significantly higher on electric boating than gas-powered boating due to the lithium-ion batteries involved. I'm not looking to start a heated political discussion - I want to keep this as neutral as possible. What do you think the tariffs will do to electric boating in America? Will it reduce the popularity relative to gas (after battery prices came tumbling down in the last 2 years as cheap LFPs flooded the market)? Will consumers continue paying the higher prices? Will more people buy equipment second-hand? Will battery and motor prices continue dropping, counteracting the impact of the tariffs?",1738558625.0,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricBoats/comments/1ighe5d/impact_of_tariffs_on_electric_boating/

The motor is 1400 watts at 48V. The video you're watching was us traveling up the ICW on the busiest day I've ever seen on the water. It did well. 

Top speed achieved was roughly 6MPH (inaccurately measured with my phone). I wouldn't call that accurate as wind and current affected us both positively and negatively in my tests, and I plan to take it to a lake with an actual GPS to get more reliable results with no current.

The boat came with a 4HP Coleman outboard, and the last time we went out I dang near converted it into a wireless anchor. Not wanting to polite the water, I took it back home and decided to either get a new gas outboard or go electric. We decided on electric for reliability and ease. 

The motor is 1400 watts at 48V. The video you're watching was us traveling up the ICW on the busiest day I've ever seen on the water. It did well. 

Top speed achieved was roughly 6MPH (inaccurately measured with my phone). I wouldn't call that accurate as wind and current affected us both positively and negatively in my tests, and I plan to take it to a lake with an actual GPS to get more reliable results with no current. 

Overall, I'm happy. The motor pushes the boat about the same as the 4hp gasoline outboard did in both propulsion and top-end speed. I plan to upgrade the motor to a 3KW in the future, but I am waiting for Newport Vessels to release their NT600. I love how quiet it is and how there is no vibration as compared to the old motor. 

Overall runtime with my battery setup is roughly 3.5 hours at WOT. The total cost for battery and motor was about $1100. Motor is a Hightime P260 Brushless and the battery is 48V @100AH.",1750630127.0,9,13,https://v.redd.it/icy2n6uyxj8f1

1kucojx,electricboats,Converted my 23ft Trailer Sailer to Electric on the cheap and sailed 50nm across Lake Michigan,"Converted my 23ft Trailer Sailer to Electric on the cheap and sailed 50nm across Lake Michigan O'day 23-2, roughly 4000lbs loaded, with a swing centerboard and 2.5ft to 5.5ft draft. Using a Newport NT300 36v outboard with a cheap, Amazon 100Ah LiFePo4 drive battery recharged with shore power and a residential charger. I will not share the brand of battery /charger, they're all the same if you're trying to cheap out, roll the dice. Total cost of drive components and charger was $1700 with tax in February including upgrading terminal covers to be in USCG compliance (not pictured). The 100ah battery fit in the old gas lazarette (barely, after trimming down the handles), which is conveniently vented, splash resistant and will be insulated this summer. Eventually I'm stowing it low in the cabin. 

In addition to docking, ran it for roughly 12 miles over 3hrs, testing between 5% and 100% output in various conditions. HARD caveat that this may not work the same for all boats of similar size/shape, this isn't enough testing to determine reliability, and I haven't played with all settings or conducted more scientific testing (and caveat emptor).  Seems like a very good outboard and ""conventional logic"" about motor HP is wrong as this is a 3HP equiv replacing a 8HP 2-stroke on a boat much larger than the outboard is marketed for. Note: all math is conservative from the napkin with a 5% reserve calculated in. Results:

-5% to 8% was more than enough to maintain docking, harbor maneuvering and control at 1-2 knots. The range you'd get with this is more than I have patience to travel or math at this speed. 
-
- 10% drove the boat at 3 knots in calm to 10 knot wind and 1-ft swells. The smart money is to only use the motor this way, seems to draw less than 250w and if you know your DIY EV math, that means you can run the boat for roughly 18 hours on a 100Ah battery. That's 50+ miles of lazy harbor and canal sailing. This also worked for motorsailing well: with main and outboard running in light wind, this was a comfortable 5 knots which is all you can hope for in a small sailboat. 
-
- 40% pushed the boat at hull speed, 5-6 knots even in 20 knot winds with sails down. Lake Michigan is not a casual lake, and this was a pleasing result because we were fighting 1-2ft swells with a short period and 35 knot gusts without having to push it above 40%. This is about 750w and 4.5 hours of run time, for a hypothetical 25 miles of range. More than enough for a weekend sailor who should be using sails 90% of the time 
-
- 60% to 100% was ridiculous but fun. Tried it on the river, it didn't plane but we made significant wake and exceeded hull speed. On the open water, this is just a waste of battery because the propeller jumps out of the water and cavitates too much at the height of my outboard. 

Thoughts: 
- Get the long shaft outboard if you're using this for a 20ft+ sailboat, do not settle for the standard length. Pay extra, pay for shipping, don't do a third-party seller, whatever you have to do to get the long shaft version. I'm modifying my boat instead, as I'm a broke gal after playing with my boat all winter. 😅
- Get multiple 36v batteries or the smallest batteries plausible for your use case. It's a very easy job to swap batteries, you just unscrew terminals. The 100Ah battery was overkill for my use case and is extremely heavy at 66lbs. Two 50Ah batteries could be carried off the dock and charged at home. This would save a ton of money on installing a shore power system. 
- Plan for not being able to see your display in the sun. They should really fix that. I'm going to experiment with a tinted film. 
-36v is a fairly rare and expensive voltage to work with, 48v would be cheaper batteries and the US standard. If I replace this system it will be with the new 6HP outboard they're releasing.
- This is probably not waterproof or even very water resistant without modification. It is likely not durable enough for extreme situations. However, for the price of a 3HP Torqueedo and almost the same capacity of proprietary batteries, I could replace this system 3 times.

I'm between Seattle and Bellingham WA.

I have this 12ft Seanymph I bought used last year and I got this specific one because the guy sold it with a nice salt-rated 55lb thrust minn kota and a newish LiTime 12v 100ah lifepo battery+charger. 

Max speed I can get with this setup is about 4mph. The data plate on the hull says 5hp max but I know it's common to size up by beefing up the transom. I've never run a larger motor on this hull before but I'm mostly curious at what speed it will plane. 

As you might guess, I have less than no interest in a gas outboard at this point (been there, done that) and am willing to spend $$$ on an electric system if it'll pop this thing on plane.

1dyc0wf,electricboats,Review: one month of Newport NT300 ownership,"Review: one month of Newport NT300 ownership So, at the end of last sailing season, I decided my 5hp 4-stroke Tohatsu had caused me enough stress for one lifetime and it was time to pull the trigger on an electric outboard for my 23ft, 2700lb sailboat. Usecase: the half mile between my slip and open water, and the limp home, maybe 2-4 miles, when the wind dies

So on Black Friday 2023 I bought a Newport NT300 long shaft and Newport's 36v 40ah LiFePO4 battery. The Black Friday sale event was the 40ah battery for the price of the 30ah battery. Total cost was ~$1800, with $820 battery, $1150 motor, and a 10% discount code from signing up for spam

Motor was in storage since December, I just charged the battery every three months (more on this later). Given that it's been in use since the start of the season, I figured I'd share my impressions for anyone else interested in sticking one of these on a ""big"" boat:

# The good:

1. The motor and battery are both amazingly light and solidly built. Setup is ""charge the battery"". Getting the motor in and out of my boat's outboard well is easy since it's so light

1. The motor has plenty of power to push my boat around; most of the motoring I do through the marina is a slow cruise at about 30% power, drawing ~200w. At that draw I have about 7 hours of battery life (1440wh battery). Way more than I need on a single outing

1. Throttled down, the motor gives very fine control entering and leaving the slip. A true luxury I didn't think about before using it is that the power floor is significantly lower than the lowest throttle of my old gas outboard. Another benefit: never worrying about it cutting out at that low throttle

# The bad:

1. There's a learning curve to LiFePO4 batteries, and Newport support is not there to help you. My battery voltage dropped below the included charger's 30v minimum cutoff (the charger is sold separately now, making it even more unreasonable that it can't charge a battery from 0% - just get one on Amazon that can for half the price), despite my following instructions and charging it to 50% at three month intervals. The support team over email was at best vague and at worst *intentionally misleading*, before just ghosting me when I asked for clarification. I was much better off with general information regarding LiFePO4 battery recharging from the internet. Battery is now working great :)

1. Correlary to \#1 above, the battery manuals don't explain some important points (like above, that you need to trickle-charge the battery if it's been depleted below 30V, that this process is a little hazardous relative to normal charging because of LiFePO4 chemistry and that it may lower battery capacity so try hard to avoid it), for example that the bluetooth battery app is the best source of state-of-charge information since reading voltage via meter or via the motor's built-in gauge is way less accurate. The manual doesn't even mention the existence of bluetooth or the app

# Overall:

I'm very pleased with my purchase, and I'm never going back to gas. However, Newport's support experience is lacking, and in recent months they've hiked prices and started charging for the previously included chargers. I'm glad the motor uses a separate battery with standard terminals for the option to (one day) buy a replacement from a different manufacturer. I think that for now, this makes Newport the best low-horsepower electric outboard on the market, and I'm also optimistic that it will mean plenty of competitors come along to offer alternatives and push up the standard of service",1720453219.0,7,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricBoats/comments/1dyc0wf/review_one_month_of_newport_nt300_ownership/
